0,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Our nation is engaged in a historic battle against the invisible enemy. To win this fight, we have undertaken the greatest national mobilization since World War Two. And that's exactly what it's been."
1,2020-04-05,"We've marshaled every instrument of American power, and we've unleashed our most potent weapon of all: the courage of the American people."
2,2020-04-05,"These have been trying times. A cruel virus from a distant land has unfairly claimed thousands of precious American lives. To every citizen who has lost a cherished loved one: Your pain is our pain. We mourn as one national family. Our country has come together. We draw solace from the faith that God has received, and the departed — He has taken the departed into his eternal and loving embrace. They will never be forgotten."
3,2020-04-05,"Over the last weeks and months, millions of Americans have joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt the spread of this horrible disease. The Army built field hospitals and sports arenas and convention centers. The Army Corps of Engineers is great. Over 20,000 beds in record time."
4,2020-04-05,The Navy sailed hospital ships to our biggest cities. Lifesaving supplies and experimental medicines were rushed to the frontlines as we launched a rapid search for groundbreaking treatments and vaccines.
5,2020-04-05,"We built the most advanced and robust testing anywhere in the world, and we've done more testing than any country anywhere in the world."
6,2020-04-05,We suspended dangerous foreign travel. We leveraged our industrial base to produce vast quantities of critical medical gear and enacted a historic 2-trillion-dollar relief package.
7,2020-04-05,"Through it all, we have seen the heroism of our doctors and nurses like never before — these are our warriors — the bravery of our truck drivers — such bravery — and food suppliers — such incredible bravery, and the determination and drive of our citizens. Through this unified national endeavor, we have made great progress. You could really say incredible progress."
8,2020-04-05,"Our experts and scientists report that our strategy to slow the spread has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Models predicted between 1.5 million and 2.2 million U.S. deaths — if there was no mitigation, it could have even been higher than that — and between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths with mitigation. It's looking like we will come far under even these lowest numbers."
9,2020-04-05,"Thanks to our all-out military operation and the extraordinary devotion of our people, we believe we will experience far fewer deaths than even the optimistic projection. But there is no such thing as an optimistic projection on death. One person is too many."
10,2020-04-05,"Our experts say the curve has flattened and the peak in new cases is behind us. Nationwide, more than 850 counties, or nearly 30 percent of our country, have reported no new cases in the last seven days."
11,2020-04-05,"Because of our early and aggressive action, we have avoided the tragedy of healthcare rationing and deadly shortfalls that have befallen many other nations — nations which, wherever possible, we are helping. In America, no person who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. We're making hundreds of thousands of ventilators. We've delivered thousands and thousands of ventilators to the states."
12,2020-04-05,"And actually, it's been an incredible operation. We started with very little and we ended with a lot. The United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries."
13,2020-04-05,"Based on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we're calling, “Opening Up America Again.” And that's what we're doing: We're opening up our country. And we have to do that. America wants to be open, and Americans want to be open."
14,2020-04-05,"As I have said for some time now, a national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution. To preserve the health of our citizens, we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy. Over the long haul, you can't do one without the other. It cannot be done. To keep vital supply chains running, these chains have to be taken care of so delicately. They're delicate. The balance is delicate."
15,2020-04-05,"We want to deliver food and medical supply. We must have a working economy. And we want to get it back very, very quickly, and that's what's going to happen. I believe it will boom."
16,2020-04-05,"A prolonged lockdown combined with a forced economic depression would inflict an immense and wide-ranging toll on public health. This includes a sharp rise in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, suicide, heart disease, and many other dimensions of physical and mental wellbeing. Moreover, many patients have put needed medical care on hold, creating entirely new hazards for public health."
17,2020-04-05,Our country has suffered. The world has suffered. One hundred and eighty-four other countries have suffered.
18,2020-04-05,"Therefore, my administration is issuing new federal guidelines that will allow governors to take a phased and deliberate approach to reopening their individual states. I've dealt with them now a long time, and we've had a great relationship — Democrat, Republican. The relationship has been good. This strategy is based on hard, verifiable data."
19,2020-04-05,"I want to thank Dr. Birx for her incredible leadership in crafting these guidelines in consultation with scientists, experts, and medical professionals across government. Dr. Birx will explain the guidelines in more detail in a few moments. And Dr. Fauci has been absolutely terrific. We've all worked together, and we've worked together well."
20,2020-04-05,"They are interested in the health of our country. And we're all interested in the viability and making us truly great again. We took the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we closed it in order to win this war. And we're in the process of winning it now."
21,2020-04-05,"Our approach outlines three phases in restoring our economic life. We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time. And some states will be able to open up sooner than others. Some states are not in the kind of trouble that others are in."
22,2020-04-05,"Now that we have passed the peak in new cases, we're starting our life again, we're starting rejuvenation of our economy again, in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion."
23,2020-04-05,"Our strategy will continue to protect senior citizens and other vulnerable populations while allowing military and other groups of incredibly talented people to go about their real business and the business that's supposed to be hard at work at doing. And nobody does it better. Our military is the greatest anywhere in the world, and we're so thankful for what they've done."
24,2020-04-05,"Healthy Americans will now be able to return to work as conditions on the ground allow. Instead of a blanket shutdown, we will pursue a focus on sheltering the highest-risk individuals. So important. We're establishing clear scientific, metric, and — benchmarks on testing, new case growth, and hospital capacity that must be met before advancing to each phase. And that's each phase specifically in the reopening of our country."
25,2020-04-05,"This is a gradual process. As the caseload in a state continues to go down, restrictions can continue to be eased and come off. Throughout the process, citizens will continue to be called upon to use all of their weapons in this war: vigorous hygiene, teleworking when possible, staying at home if you feel sick, maintaining social distance, sanitizing commonly used surfaces, and being highly conscious of their surroundings. Those are our weapons, and they're very powerful weapons indeed."
26,2020-04-05,"Governors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states. Every state is very different. They're all beautiful. We love them all. But they're very, very different. If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that. And if they believe it is time to reopen, we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task — and very, very quickly — depending on what they want to do."
27,2020-04-05,"We are also encouraging states to work together to harmonize their regional efforts. We'll have numerous cases where states have worked and will be working very, very closely together."
28,2020-04-05,"As we reopen, we know that there will be continued hardships and challenges ahead. Our goal will be to quickly identify and address any outbreaks and put them out rapidly. If the virus returns in the fall, as some scientists think it may possibly, these guidelines will ensure that our country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly."
29,2020-04-05,"At the heart of our strategy is the vital role of medical research, especially for therapies that will significantly improve outcomes for high-risk patients and reduce the need for urgent care. This will be tremendously valuable in allowing life to eventually return to normal. At least 35 clinical trials are already underway, including antiviral therapies, immune therapies, and blood therapies in the form of convalescent plasma. You've all heard about some of these events and some of these therapies. They've come a long way. What's been done in the last four weeks is incredible."
30,2020-04-05,"We will also continue to expand our testing capacity. We have now completed more than 3.5 million tests — by far the most anywhere in the world. Areas of our country that have been hotspots have done much more testing, on a per capita basis, than South Korea. We've done more than South Korea — and South Korea has done a good job, but we've done more."
31,2020-04-05,"We will continue to work with governors to advise them on how to conduct both surveillance and diagnostic testing. We have now distributed over 600,000 Abbott ID NOW point-of-care diagnostic tests. These are tests that are done on site, and, within five minutes, you know the answer: positive or negative."
32,2020-04-05,"In recent days, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests performed by hospitals and academic institutions, with more than 120,000 tests recently reported in a single day — far more than any country in the world has ever been able to do. And our numbers are actually going up."
33,2020-04-05,"As these new and better testing solutions come online, we're seeing this additional capacity reflected in the numbers. For this reason, the number of tests processed in commercial laboratories has dropped from approximately 100,000 to roughly 75,000 tests over the last week. The reason it dropped is because we have so many other tests and we don't even have to go through the laboratories. But the laboratories have tremendous additional capacity, and states feel free to use that capacity."
34,2020-04-05,"Some in the media falsely reported this as a bad thing, when, in fact, it is a great thing because it indicates that the states are moving to faster, more local testing solutions, including on-the-spot tests."
35,2020-04-05,"So this drop in the utilization of commercial laboratories is an affirmation that testing, which is at an all-time high, is growing at a historic rate. In other words, the laboratories are great, but now we have forms of testing that are much quicker, much better, and we don't have to use the laboratories. But they're there, and they have a great capacity to do the work."
36,2020-04-05,"As Dr. Birx has been advising our governors for weeks, we continue to have an excess testing capacity of 1 million tests per week available for use. And our capabilities are growing every single day, especially with the new tests that are coming onto the market rapidly."
37,2020-04-05,"As we begin a science-based reopening, we must be extra vigilant in blocking the foreign entry of the virus from abroad. Border control, travel restrictions, and other limitations on entry are more important than ever to keep the virus in check and allow Americans to get back to work."
38,2020-04-05,"The sacrifices our citizens have made in this time of crisis will be remembered, studied, honored, and praised for generations to come. We're really all working together. Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal — we're all working together. This is not about parties; this is about our country."
39,2020-04-05,"Now the American people are ready to rise to the occasion once again. They are ready to show the world once more that Americans can defeat any challenger. Together, we will rebuild this land that we love, we will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share, and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of greatness and glory."
40,2020-04-05,"I would now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Birx to further explain the new guidelines. I want to thank Dr. Birx. I want to thank Dr. Fauci. And I want to thank, really especially, a man who has devoted 24 hours a day to his task force and done such an incredible job — our great Vice President, Mike Pence."
41,2020-04-05,"Please, Mike."
42,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Please, Tony."
43,2020-04-05,Right.
44,2020-04-05,"I did. I heard from a number of governors that said they're in very good shape. I also heard — not only from the call, but I heard from some of the governors previous — and I think you'll have some very good things to report over the next few days about states opening up."
45,2020-04-05,"And I think, Jon, having to do with your call on — on sports: Depending on the area, depending where we're talking about, you're going to have large areas of our country where this has not been or has been totally eradicated. You'll be able to have those full arenas."
46,2020-04-05,"Now, with everything being said, a lot of great work has been done on vaccines, but you have a testing process. Therapeutics, likewise — we have a lot of great things happening, therapeutically. That will be a step further."
47,2020-04-05,"But, in terms of sports, they'll probably start off — I — as you know, I spoke to the commissioners yesterday — almost, I guess, of every sport. And many of them are going to be starting without the fans. So it'll be made for television. The good old days, made for television. And it'll go that way, and then fans will start coming in. Maybe they'll be separated by two seats. And then ultimately, we want to have packed arenas. When the virus is gone, we're going to have packed arenas and we're going to be back to enjoying sports the way they're supposed to be. And the same thing can be said for restaurants."
48,2020-04-05,"So, at a certain point in time, when the virus is gone, we're going to be back to normal."
49,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
50,2020-04-05,"Well, they're going to be in place, to a large extent, and it also depends on the governors, what they want to do. You have very different states. If you look at Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota — that's a lot different than New York. It's a lot different than New Jersey. So it's going to be very dependent on the governor."
51,2020-04-05,"We're recommending — as you see in the charts, we're recommending certain things. They'll be in place, dependent on what the governor wants to do. If we see something wrong, we will be expressing ourselves very strongly."
52,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
53,2020-04-05,You're talking about those states that are in great shape already?
54,2020-04-05,"They will be able to go literally tomorrow, yes — because they've met all of the guidelines if you go back — you're going back 14 days, you're going back even a month. And they have — the ones that I'm thinking about, the ones that I've already spoken to governors about — they've met those guidelines, actually, pretty long ago."
55,2020-04-05,"Well, they've been going through it a long time, Jon, and it's been a tough process for people. You know, I told you this: There's death and there's problems in staying at home too. It's not just, “Isn't it wonderful to stay at home?” They're having — they're suffering. This country wasn't built on that principle; it was built on an exact opposite principle, actually."
56,2020-04-05,"And I watched, in one particular state, where they were — they want to get back. They want to get back. They were very strict sanctions that were put on people; that was probably the most strict of all."
57,2020-04-05,"But, I just think the American people have been incredible. When you look at —"
58,2020-04-05,"Jon, when you look at what they've done, when you look at what they've been through, when you look at all of the death and all of the problems and all of the sickness, when you look at what's happened, I just think the American people have been incredible."
59,2020-04-05,I think they're listening. I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me and respect this opinion. And my opinion is the same as just about all of the governors.
60,2020-04-05,"They all want to open. Nobody wants to stay shut, but they want to open safely. So do I. But we have large sections of the country right now that can start thinking about opening. There'll be some mitigation and they'll keep it going for a period of time — including masks, by the way — in areas that you wouldn't even think."
61,2020-04-05,"I asked a question today. I said, “Why would they wear masks in Wyoming or Montana or North Dakota?” And that's if somebody should come in from an area that isn't so successful, in terms of what they've done."
62,2020-04-05,"So, that will be a governor's choice, and we'll have no problem with it."
63,2020-04-05,"Right. So, just for the viewers watching this or hearing you ask that question: “Exhausted” is a good thing, not a bad thing. It went quickly. It is so popular. The banks have been incredible, including 4,000 community banks. Four thousand. Most people didn't know you had that many banks. Four thousand —"
64,2020-04-05,"What they want is people want to keep this going. And we're doing it to keep the small businesses open and to keep the workers paid. And we have a $250 billion request. The Democrats like it. The Republicans love it. And to be honest, I think it's going to — something is going to be happening. I hope so, because this is a very popular program. It was really executed flawlessly."
65,2020-04-05,"The first day, they changed an application a little bit. There was — but when you look at what Bank of America did and what Wells Fargo did, and Citi and a lot of the banks — but when you ask —"
66,2020-04-05,"— when you look at what all of the community banks did, it's been really incredible."
67,2020-04-05,"Well, we're negotiating with Democrats, and they should, frankly, approve it quickly. This is a great thing for our country. It's a great thing for small business and for the workers. And we're having a hard time getting them to approve it. I think it's going to happen. It should happen really unanimously. But they're trying to get things and we're not too happy with what they're trying to get."
68,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
69,2020-04-05,"I'd rather not say that, but you'll be seeing it very soon. I mean, they'll be — I'd rather have the governor be able to — the governors be able to announce. And they're very proud of it. They've worked hard. Some are in an area that's less susceptible and some really was done, I think we can say, through talent. They really worked very hard."
70,2020-04-05,"And, you know, we have some states that got too much credit for what they've done. Frankly, I could name you a couple of those too. And I could name you a couple of them. And we have others that haven't been given credit that have done a phenomenal job."
71,2020-04-05,"Well, that's not going to be normal. There's not going to be a new normal where somebody has been having, for 25 years, 158 seats in a restaurant, and now he's got 30 or he's got 60 — because that wouldn't work. That's not normal. No. Normal will be if he has the 158 or 68 seats. And that's going to happen. And it's going to happen, relatively quickly, we hope."
72,2020-04-05,"But that's our normal. Our normal is if you have 100,000 people in an Alabama football game — or 110,000, to be exact — we want 110,000 people there. We want every seat occupied. Normal is not going to be where you have a game with 50,000 people."
73,2020-04-05,We're going to be watching over. We're going to see that everything is working out smoothly. We're in very strong communication with the governors.
74,2020-04-05,"We're going to be helping with testing. They're going to be doing the testing. It's got to be a localized thing, and it really has been since I've been involved. Because I came in and the federal government supposed to do testing of parking lots in the middle of a certain state that's 2,000 miles away. It's ridiculous. But the testing has been so incredible."
75,2020-04-05,"Two things: testing and ventilators. Ventilators are really tough. They're very complex. They're very expensive. They're, you know, very sophisticated machines. Some are unbelievably sophisticated. What we built — you saw General Motors yesterday. Thousands are being issued. We have 11 companies building them. We have not had one complaint in the last week and half, which is surge time."
76,2020-04-05,"Don't forget, when they were calling, they were calling because in two weeks, in four weeks, in five weeks, they're going to need ventilators — not because they need them right now. And we were right on our counts. And nobody that wanted a ventilator didn't get a ventilator. Plus, we have additional, if there is a surge. We hope there's not going to be a surge at all. But we're going to be able to build up the stockpiles of states who didn't have them, who should have had them."
77,2020-04-05,"And we're also going to have a big stockpile in the federal government, and we'll be able to help foreign countries — countries that need help. Because you have comp- — look, you have countries who will never be able to build a ventilator. It's tough stuff. We're uniquely talented in the sense that we can do things that nobody else can do."
78,2020-04-05,"We'll get right back to you, John."
79,2020-04-05,"Peter, in the back. Peter."
80,2020-04-05,"Well, I think — yeah, Peter. I think 29 states are in that ballgame, not open — not for opening, but I think they'll be able to open relatively soon. I think the remainder are just getting better. Look, New York, New Jersey are having very tough times, and they'll be there. They'll be there at some point. But they're not going to be one of the earlier states; they're going to be later, obviously."
81,2020-04-05,"I just spoke with the governor of New Jersey. We just spoke with Mike and a couple of folks. We had a great talk with him. Phil is a terrific guy. He's working very hard — Democrat — but we get along. He's working very, very hard. I guess, the fact that he's right next to this big massive city where everybody is very closely — you know, they're — they're together. And New Jersey has been hit unbelievably hard — as hard as — as hard as anybody, in the true sense. But they're doing a great job in New Jersey."
82,2020-04-05,"That doesn't mean, Peter — that doesn't mean that they're going to be opening next week. That's not one that's going to be. But we have a lot of states that, through location, through luck, and also through a lot of talent — we have states, through a lot of talent, are in a very good position, and they're getting ready to open and over the next very short period of time."
83,2020-04-05,"It's going to be up to the governors. We're going to work with them, we're going to help them, but it's going to be up to the governors. I think they're going to — I think you're going to see quite a few states starting to open. And I call it a “beautiful puzzle.” You have 50 pieces, all very different, but when it's all done, it's a mosaic. When it's all done, it's going to be, I think, a very beautiful picture."
84,2020-04-05,"And very important is what Dr. Fauci said: It could be that, sometime in the fall, there'll be some flare-ups. We're going to be in a great position with everything we've done and everything we've learned. This was something that nobody ever saw before: such contagion and very, very powerful."
85,2020-04-05,"People don't realize because you — we all probably have friends — I have a number of people that were just great people who were just decimated by what happened. Some were — some were — some are dead right now. They're dead. They went into a hospital. One called me; he said, “I tested positive.” Four days later, he was dead. The following day after he said that, he was unconscious. So this is a tough deal."
86,2020-04-05,"At the same time, some people got sniffles and they didn't even realize they had a problem. And they are supposedly immune. We're going to find out about that. Even that's a little bit soon because we don't know how long the immunity lasts."
87,2020-04-05,"But, Peter, some states are in great shape, and they're really in great shape to open. And I think you'll have quite a few states opening soon. And they're going to be very vigilant, they're going to be very careful."
88,2020-04-05,Go ahead. (Inaudible.)
89,2020-04-05,"Sure, we can do that. Either one, please."
90,2020-04-05,"Tony, did you want to say something?"
91,2020-04-05,"Peter, I just have to say that, as we see a hotspot possibly developing — maybe not — but if we see a hotspot developing, we've learned a lot. We'll be able to suppress it, whack it. We'll be able to do things that people weren't even thinking about because nobody has ever gone through this."
92,2020-04-05,"In 1917, they went through something that was similar. Probably not as contagious, probably more powerful in certain other ways. But we are going to be able to suppress it, we think. And we're going to watch it very closely. We're going to — we're going to be able to watch things very closely."
93,2020-04-05,Please.
94,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Bob, please."
95,2020-04-05,"And one other thing, because we — we discussed this today with the senators — we had the senators, we have the congressmen and women. There'll be some areas of our country — wide open plains, wide open spaces — with not that many people, relatively speaking, where you're not going to have to do that. Senators were saying there is no reason to do that in certain states, in certain areas, where you have the wide open."
96,2020-04-05,"In other cases, we will be doing that. So we'll be following it. Largely, that also will be a function of governors. They know their states. So, largely, that's going to be a function of governors."
97,2020-04-05,Yes.
98,2020-04-05,Yeah.
99,2020-04-05,"We do have the capacity, but, you know, you have states without any problem. You have states with few cases, and those few cases have healed. You have states with very little death, relatively speaking. As I said, one is too many, but you have states with very little, and frankly, they're at a point where they have almost nothing."
100,2020-04-05,"So this is a much different case than a New York or New Jersey where they're going through — frankly, they go through hell. And if you look at New York — I'm looking at bed count, because you have to look at bed count, and it's really dropped. We built the Javits Center with 2,900 beds. And it was — I mean, they built it in four days. They did an incredible job — the Army Corps of Engineers. It was not used very much. We sent the ship — the hospital ship into New York Harbor, and it was not used. Then we went COVID, and it still was not used very much, because the bed count has gone way down — way, way down."
101,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
102,2020-04-05,"This is — this is not campaigning. I want to make the country better. I don't care about campaigning. This is — this is about making our country better. I think this team has been incredible, whether it's Army Corps of Engineers, whether it's FEMA."
103,2020-04-05,"One thing that happened on the call today that I noticed more than anything is Pete Gaynor. So many governors that, “I want to thank you.” Pete Gaynor called up. They had tornadoes in a big part of our country this weekend — this week. And they were all saying that he has been unbelievable. They called one after another. They were thanking us for — that's FEMA. And they were thanking us."
104,2020-04-05,"No, I want to heal this country. This — this is a war. We've been through a war. We have an invisible, as opposed to a visible, enemy. I think, in many ways, the invisible enemy is much more dangerous, is much tougher."
105,2020-04-05,"In the G7 today, I went through country after country. We were there. We all get along great. Angela Merkel and Shinzo Abe — Prime Minister of Japan — and all of them. And their — their countries have been devastated by this. Their economies have been devastated by this. A hundred and eighty-four countries all over the world."
106,2020-04-05,"And we went through one after another. And I was angry because it should have been told to us. It should have been told to us early. It should have been told to us a lot sooner. People knew it was happening, and people didn't want to talk about it. I don't know why, but we're going to get to the bottom of it. But people should have —"
107,2020-04-05,People — I'm not saying anything. I'm saying people should have told us about this. They should have told the rest of the world too.
108,2020-04-05,"When I looked at Germany talking today, when I looked at France talking today — the European Union was there represented; that represents a lot of countries — their economies have been devastated, but they're going to build them back. But we're going to build this economy back bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You watch. And we have stimulus."
109,2020-04-05,"And we're going to do things, whether it's infrastructure — which we would like to be able to do — our roads, our tunnels, our highways, our bridges. Our bridges need help. You know, a lot of you have reported on our bridges. A lot of bridges are in bad shape. They should have been fixed 25 years ago, and they're still standing. They have to be fixed. So hopefully we'll get an infrastructure bill."
110,2020-04-05,The good news is the interest rate is close to zero. And zero interest is a good thing when it comes to rebuilding your infrastructure and your country back.
111,2020-04-05,"Please, in the back."
112,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't like to anticipate because you have a couple of states that are in difficulty that have made a lot of progress, by the way, and they're either here or they're heading down. But — so I'm not going to go in, in terms of dates, but I think we're going very quickly now. I really believe."
113,2020-04-05,"I think we're going to have a lot of states open relatively soon. We're beating the date. I set a date of May 1st, and, you know, here we are. And I think you're going to have some nice surprises over the next few days. And that'll be before. And that's big stuff. Some of those states are big. They're big stuff. Very important states. And it's going to be added on and on."
114,2020-04-05,"And as we — look, I don't want anyone coming back that isn't in position to come back. The last thing we want is for, let's say, a New York to come back too soon or a New Jersey to come back to soon. We want them to come back when they're ready. But they're really heading in a good direction, and I think it'll be much faster than people think. I think it'll be quicker. But it's got to be safe."
115,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. In the back."
116,2020-04-05,"So, if we didn't do what we did, we were talking about up to 2.2 million deaths. So that's five times almost what we lost in the Civil War. Okay?"
117,2020-04-05,"If — if everything happens properly and if we continue to go the way we're going now, we will be significantly less than the lowest number with mitigation. So we'll be significantly less. And it's still a lot of people. One is too many, as I've said. One is too many. But we'll be under the number of 100,000, which was the minimum number projected by the model. And I give — I give everybody up here, I give all of the people that we've been — I mean, we — this was a military operation with a lot of private help."
118,2020-04-05,"If you look at Roche, they were incredible. If you look at Johnson &amp; Johnson now, what they're doing — they are very far advanced on a vaccine. I think, therapeutically, we have some of these genius company — they're truly genius companies. I'm seeing them. I'm meeting with the people that run the companies and scientists. And, I mean, what they're doing is incredible. It's incredible. It's a beautiful thing to see."
119,2020-04-05,"So I think we're very far advanced, and I think we're going to be in great shape soon."
120,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
121,2020-04-05,Do you mean Washington State or Washington here?
122,2020-04-05,"Well, that's going to be up to them. They're going to have to make that determination. I mean, the governor of Washington was saying that he can't find cotton because — you know, a swab is a very easy thing to get. And swab is — essentially, it's a little bit more sophisticated than a Q-tip. And you got to be able to go out and find. You know, the federal government shouldn't be forced to go and do everything."
123,2020-04-05,"What we've done is incredible. What we've done are the — the ones that can't be done — like, for instance, the ventilators — that can't be done by anybody but a very powerful, very great manufacturing country, which is what we are and what we're really getting to be."
124,2020-04-05,"And I have to tell you, some of these companies, what — the job they've done — and we're going to recognize them pretty soon — the job they've done in terms of getting out, in particular, ventilators, because ventilators are so hard. They're so — I say, and some people say, “Oh, it's not really as complicated.” Well, it's like building a car. And you know what? The price is the same too. It's a very expensive thing for a sophisticated ventilator. It's very, very tough stuff."
125,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. In the back."
126,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I'll let you —"
127,2020-04-05,I'll let you guys —
128,2020-04-05,"So, just so you understand — excuse me. Just so you understand, we have tremendous testing capacity. You look at the labs; they're actually saying, “Send us.” And the reason it's gone down is because we have so many other tests that, frankly, are easier because you don't have to send. They're on site. And now we have the new saliva test that just came out yesterday, which is probably the easiest of them all, when you get right down to it."
129,2020-04-05,"And I was seeing where Rutgers is involved — great school, great college, great university — and they're using that. So many people are going to want to use that. But they don't have to use the labs anymore. The labs are great, highly accurate. Very, very great companies. But they're down. They have tremendous — as that goes down, you have additional capacity."
130,2020-04-05,"We have tremendous testing capacity. And to think that a month and a half ago, we had virtually nothing."
131,2020-04-05,"I just want to conclude: We're opening up our great country again. It's going to be over a period of time. We're working with some really great people — people that have become friends of mine. And I'm including Democrat governors that have really done a good job; Republican governors, most of whom I've known that have done a really good job. They're all working together. We're all for the — with few exceptions, the relationship has been outstanding. And I want to thank Doctor, Doctor, and Mike. I want to thank the Director. Fantastic job. We've all done — by the way, head of the FDA, he has broken hurdles that years ago, even recently, would have taken years. He was — he got one thing done in one day that would have taken two years for somebody else. So I want to thank Dr. Hahn of the FDA."
132,2020-04-05,"We have incredible people that we're working with. And we're going to bring our country back, and it's going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. We have learned a lot. We've learned a lot about ourselves."
133,2020-04-05,"I want to thank everybody. And most importantly, I want to thank the American people. Thank you all very much. Thank you."
134,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Appreciate it. A lot of tremendous things are happening. The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide. Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing. The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what's going on. And they're going down; they're going in the right direction. Cases in the Boston area are now declining. The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific. And Detroit is past its peak."
135,2020-04-05,"These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen. It's very exciting. It was very exciting, even today, watching and seeing what's happening. And people are getting ready and they're all excited."
136,2020-04-05,I do want to mention a man who's done a very good job for us: Dr. Robert Redfield. He was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus. Totally misquoted. I spoke to him. He said it was ridiculous. He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time. And corona could be just some little flare-ups that we'll take care of. We're going to knock it out. We'll knock it out fast. But that's what he was referring to: coming together at the same time.
137,2020-04-05,"And I think rather than waiting, I'd ask Dr. Redfield to come up, say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn't say it was a big — a big explosion. The headline in the Washington Post was totally inaccurate. The statement wasn't bad in the Post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is — as I say, that's fake news. And CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew. They were asked to change it, and they wouldn't do that. And it was false."
138,2020-04-05,"So I'll ask Dr. Redfield, who is, you know, a real professional, to come up and explain. Please. Thank you, Doctor."
139,2020-04-05,But I don't know what's to follow up.
140,2020-04-05,"He was misquoted. Totally misquoted. He said they could come together. They didn't talk about that. And his whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot, so that next fall we don't have such a big season of flu — and we possibly won't."
141,2020-04-05,"But, as you said, there's — it's possible, if the corona even comes back — and he doesn't know that it's going to and neither do I. We spoke a great length. And I think the doctor will speak, if you'd like to continue. But we may have some embers — and we're going to put them out — of corona. But we may have a big flu season. But that's different. Flu is very different from corona."
142,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead. Sure."
143,2020-04-05,"And you may not even have corona coming back, just so you understand."
144,2020-04-05,"Doctor, would you like to explain that."
145,2020-04-05,"What does the headline say? What does the headline say? Go ahead, read the headline."
146,2020-04-05,That's not what he says.
147,2020-04-05,It's not what he said.
148,2020-04-05,The headline doesn't correspond to the story.
149,2020-04-05,You weren't called.
150,2020-04-05,"And, Doctor, wouldn't you say there's a good chance that COVID will not come back?"
151,2020-04-05,"And if it does comes back, it's in a very small, confined area that we put out. Go ahead."
152,2020-04-05,"And if it comes back, though, it won't be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. But what the doctor was saying — and I spoke to him a great length — he was saying, if it should come back “together.” Now you have a flu and you have the embers of corona."
153,2020-04-05,"But, in my opinion, from everything I've seen, it can never be like anything that we've witnessed right now. Would you say that's a correct statement?"
154,2020-04-05,"It's nothing like what we're talking — what we've just gone though, we will not go through. You could have some embers of corona, and you could have a big flu system. And if they combine, if they come together — if they come together, it's not great. But we will not go through what we went through for the last two months."
155,2020-04-05,"Yeah, Jeff."
156,2020-04-05,Is that a correct statement?
157,2020-04-05,"What — it is estimated it might not come back at all, Jeff. It may not come back at all."
158,2020-04-05,"He's talking about a worst-case scenario where you have a big flu and you have some corona. And if it does come back, it's not going to come back — and I've spoken to 10 different people — it's not going to be like it was."
159,2020-04-05,"Also, we have much better containment now. Before, nobody knew about it. Nobody knew anything about it. We understand it. Now, if we have pockets — a little pocket here or there — we're going to have to put out. It goes out and it's going to go out fast. We're going to be watching for it."
160,2020-04-05,But it's all possible. It's also possible it doesn't come back at all.
161,2020-04-05,"I didn't say it's not. I said if it does, it's not going to come back on anything near what we went through. But you could have a mess, where they come at the same time. And if they come at the same time — the flu is not the greatest thing in the world, Jeff. It's not the greatest thing either. If they come at the same time, you have them both."
162,2020-04-05,"But if we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that's not going to be pleasant, but it's not going to be what we've gone through in any way, shape, or form."
163,2020-04-05,Yeah.
164,2020-04-05,"Because we have to have them for other reasons. Something else could come. I mean, we didn't know about corona; now we know about corona. But look at what happened. And now, we did have the H1N1 swine flu. We had that. We have other things that have happened. We had various forms of flu, but nothing like what we've had here. Nothing at all like what we've had here with the virus. But something could happen."
165,2020-04-05,"I think that the stockpiles — we're making hundreds of thousands of ventilators right now. Nobody writes about that. You know, at the one time, all they talked about was ventilators, right? Because you didn't think it was possible for me to solve that problem. And I solved it and nobody can believe it."
166,2020-04-05,"I just spoke to world leaders today who desperately need ventilators. They said, “The job you've done...” And we're sending 500 to Mexico, then another 500 to France. We're sending some to Spain. We're sending some to Italy. We have them — they're being made by the thousands."
167,2020-04-05,"And world leaders — I spoke to Prime Minister — I mean, I went through a lot of different calls today. I won't even tell you. But I went through — I can give you a list if you want — but I went through a lot of calls to a lot of leaders. Spoke with Pakistan; they would like to have some ventilators. We're going to get them some ventilators. But they all said to me one thing: It was incredible that you solved the ventilator problem because that was a big problem."
168,2020-04-05,"The testing problem. We've done more than any other nation in the world. Go a step further: If you added up the testing of every nation in the world, put them together, we've done substantially more than that. You people aren't satisfied."
169,2020-04-05,"So let's say we had 350 million people in the United States, right? Let's say. And if we gave every one of those people a test 10 times — so we give 350 people a test 10 times — the fake news media would say, “Where's the 11th time? He didn't do his job. Trump didn't do his job.” Because you have a lot of bad reporting out there. It's very sad. And it's so bad —"
170,2020-04-05,But you're one of — you're one of the leaders of the bad reporting. You know?
171,2020-04-05,"Okay, let's get onto another subject. I wanted that to be —"
172,2020-04-05,"I wanted that to be cleared up. If you want, we can get on to it later, but I want the Vice President to speak. But you ought to get the news accurately. You ought to write it — if you — if you take a look at what you wrote about the ventilators — and when we became the king of ventilators — we're making different factories all over. Ventilators by the thousands."
173,2020-04-05,"In fact, Mike got back from Wisconsin. The first thing he did, he called up. I said, “How's it going?” He said, “You're not going to believe.” He just saw a plant, a factory where they're making ventilators. I think I can say, the words were “unbelievable.” He said it was unbelievable what he saw — the quality of the equipment, the professionalism."
174,2020-04-05,A tremendous number of — how many workers would you say were there?
175,2020-04-05,Nobody thought this could be done. The fake news was very unhappy that it was done. But you guys don't ask me about ventilators anymore.
176,2020-04-05,Everybody. Everybody. Because you never mention it. You never mention it. There's no story that's what a great job we've done with ventilators.
177,2020-04-05,"We're now supplying ventilators all over the world. Because no other country could have done what we did. And you should say that's a great story. Instead you say, “Trump was slow” or — slow? We were so fast."
178,2020-04-05,"Plus, we put the ban on so much earlier. When Nancy Pelosi, as an example — you don't say this — when she's having her rally in San Francisco — in Chinatown, in San Francisco. Nobody wants to say that. If we didn't — and Dr. Fauci said this — if we didn't close our country to China, we would have been so infected, like nobody's ever seen."
179,2020-04-05,"When you saw the chart — and we were at the top of the list, in terms of success — nobody wrote it. I said, “Where — is anybody going to use that chart?” Nobody wrote it. In terms of mortality. You saw that. Nobody wrote it. Germany and our country: the most successful, in terms of mortality. Nobody wrote it."
180,2020-04-05,"It would be great if you wrote the truth, but let's get on with it because I want Mike to speak. And then we'll take some more questions, on the assumption you'd like to and I think you probably will."
181,2020-04-05,"It's been encouraging to watch states begin to open up as — and it really has been; it's a beautiful thing to see — as restrictions are lifted. We must maintain vigilance and continue practicing social distancing. I encourage governors to follow a careful, phased approach. And I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines. Very important. The governors are going to adhere, hopefully, or they're going to do what they think is best. I want them to do what they think is best, but ideally they'll adhere."
182,2020-04-05,"Wash your hands, avoid close physical contact as much as possible, and wear a face covering when distancing is impractical. There were cases."
183,2020-04-05,"We've flattened the curve and really made tremendous progress, but we must guard against a dangerous rebound. We don't want to rebound. That's so important. This is what we were just talking about. We don't want a rebound. The doctor doesn't want to rebound. These people definitely don't want to rebound. I don't think you want one, do you, huh? You especially."
184,2020-04-05,We don't want to rebounds after all this death — death — that we've suffered. Not work — I don't view it “work”; I view it “death” that was unnecessary. It should have never happened. It should have never left that little area where it started. You know it and I know it and they know it.
185,2020-04-05,"In our all-out war against the virus, we continue to make great strides on testing. Famous testing. Doing more than anybody else anywhere in the world. Nothing funny about that, Jon."
186,2020-04-05,"Most of the governors have never faced a situation like this before, but we're helping them find unused testing capacity within their states — tremendous testing capacity that the governors, in many cases, didn't know they had. And additional capabilities are coming on line every day. We're coming up with new equipment, like the Abbott Laboratories equipment — on site, five minutes. Great success. Everybody wants it. But you can only make so many of those machines, so we have many other forms of testing. We have many other machines that do it very quickly and by the millions — by the millions."
187,2020-04-05,"Our task force issued its reopening guidelines earlier than April 30th to give governors the time that they needed to develop testing capability and capacity and customized plans for their states, which many of them did. We've had some governors do a fantastic job on testing and on a lot of other things."
188,2020-04-05,"I spoke — as you know, Governor Cuomo was here. He had a — we had a great conversation on testing yesterday, and they're doing a really good job in New York."
189,2020-04-05,"We're working very closely with each of the states to help them succeed. I spoke earlier today with Governor Newsom, California. And that was all about testing, that conversation. He has been scaling up really well. Really good job. And I agreed to help him get some of the critical supplies that California needs to make use of the tremendous capacity that they've found. This is a tremendous testing capacity. And I'm going to do it very quickly. He needs certain things. I'm going to — we're going to get that to him very quickly."
190,2020-04-05,"Now, could he get it himself? Yes. But I can get it faster. He understands that. And he's done a great job. And we're going to have it to him — we're going to have a lot of it to him over the next two days. And we're going to beef it up the following week, get him a lot of additional. He's done a really terrific job in California. Some of the governors have done a fantastic job, working with us."
191,2020-04-05,"I told the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities which are in violation of the phase one guidelines for the incredible people of Georgia. They're incredible people. I love those people. They are — they're great. They've been strong, resolute."
192,2020-04-05,"But, at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right. I want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he's doing. But I want to let the governors do — now, if I see something totally egregious, totally out of line, I'll do. But I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlors and barbershops in phase one — we're going to have phase two very soon — is just too soon. I think it's too soon."
193,2020-04-05,"And I love the people. I love — I love those people that use all of those things: the spas and the beauty parlors and barbershops, tattoo parlors. I love them. But they can wait a little bit longer. Just a little bit. Not — not much. Because safety has to predominate. We have to have that. So I told the governor, very simply, that I disagree with his decision, but he has to do what he thinks is right."
194,2020-04-05,"I'm excited to announce that, in the coming weeks, the Air Force Thunderbirds — they're incredible — and the Navy Blue Angels — equally incredible — will be performing air shows over America's major cities and some of the cities that aren't major cities. They're going to be doing a lot of work — a lot of very dangerous flying. It's dangerous, you know — the odds when you start going at massive speeds and you're 18 inches away from each other. That's dangerous work."
195,2020-04-05,Your son is a great pilot. And I don't know if he could be — could he be a — could he be a Thunderbird? I don't know.
196,2020-04-05,"I think — I think he probably could, from what I hear. I don't know if I'd want him to be, because it is — it's incredible what they're able to do. And to sacrifice our frontline — what we're doing is we're paying tribute to our frontline healthcare workers confronting COVID. And it's really a signal to all Americans to remain vigilant during the outbreak. This is a — a tribute to them, to our warriors. Because they are equal warriors to those incredible pilots and all of the fighters that we have for the more traditional fights that we win. And we win. If we want to win, we always win. Sometimes we don't want to win, so we just go to a standstill. But that's always — that's not the way this country works."
197,2020-04-05,"Operation America Strong was the idea of our great military men and women — the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels crews who wanted to show support to the American medical workers who, just like military members in a time of war, are fiercely running torward the fight. It's going to be great. I want to see those shows. I've seen them many times and I can't get enough of them."
198,2020-04-05,"And on July 4th, we'll be doing what we had at the Mall, as you know. We're going to be doing it. Last year was a tremendous success and I would imagine we'll do it — hopefully, I can use the term “forever.” That was a great success as you remember, even though it was pouring. It was raining so hard. It was raining at — that was about as hard as I've seen in a while, but it was an amazing success. Didn't bother the pilots. It didn't bother the military. It didn't bother the crews that we had there. So we're going to be doing that again on July 4th."
199,2020-04-05,"Our great military is operating at 100 percent during this crisis and thousands of troops are deployed alongside of civilians in the COVID hotspots, as you know. You see them all over. I spoke — when I spoke with Governor Cuomo, and when I spoke to Gavin Newsom, and many of the other governors, they wanted to know if we could have some military help with the medical, and we — we gave it to them. And in every case, they said, “Fantastic.” I mean, just fantastic."
200,2020-04-05,"In New York City, Mayor de Blasio called me to say it was inspiring to watch. He was there when the military came in. He said it gave everybody spirit when he saw the professionalism and the spirit that they had. They walked in and they helped a lot of — a lot of people: doctors, nurses, respiratory technicians, and professionals. It was an incredible thing. But they all — everybody that saw them going to work said that was something special."
201,2020-04-05,"So we're going to have some tremendous air shows all throughout our country. And that's in honor of what we're all going through together, and the people that are helping us so much, and, unfortunately, the people who have passed away from something that should never have been allowed to happen."
202,2020-04-05,"Following around-the-clock negotiations yesterday, the Senate answered my call to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program so that millions of additional American workers can keep getting a paycheck. We just increased it by $310 billion dollars. I urged the House to pass the bill without delay. In our first round of funding, we've provided nearly $350 billion dollars, and it went at record speed to American workers and small businesses. And it's really been an incredible, incredible success."
203,2020-04-05,"I want to thank the banks. We have the big banks, the little banks, the commercial banks of all kinds. We had the community banks — who were fantastic, by the way. Community banks."
204,2020-04-05,"And as you know — this was an interesting story in recent days — I've called for Harvard — that's Harvard University, which has a $40 billion endowment fund — to return the money that it was allocated under the CARES Act. And I'm pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds, nor will Stanford University or many of the others that were involved both on a university level. Also on company level, some of the companies were bigger than people had represented or bigger than people had thought and strong enough that they didn't need the money. So there's a certain amount of money that we are not sending."
205,2020-04-05,"As soon as I heard it, I said, “Stop funds.” And for the most part, I guess, they stopped it, Mike, right? They stopped it. But we're not — they're not accepting the money, and that's great. And so I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford, and I want to thank the other companies in the case. It's broken differently between colleges and companies, but I want to thank the companies and the other great universities. And there's some great ones."
206,2020-04-05,"The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday also reserves $30 billion in loans for small financial institutions that serve minority and distressed communities. This is very important. We're determined to protect our African American, Hispanic American, and minority workers who have been hit so hard by this hidden enemy."
207,2020-04-05,"My administration is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to address the full spectrum of needs in these communities, supporting both health and economic revitalization. First, my administration is committed to providing the testing that is needed to fight the virus in distressed communities. In the last month alone, we've already sent over $1.4 billion to our nation's 13,000 community healthcare centers — think of that, 13,000 — to increase testing and treatment in the underserved areas."
208,2020-04-05,"We're also expanding access to telehealth. Telehealth has become a big deal. You know, I've been reading about it for years, and all of a sudden, because of this, it's become a big — a big thing. People can't leave their houses. They didn't want to leave their houses for various reasons, including they wanted to follow the guidelines."
209,2020-04-05,"The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday — and I want to thank everybody. A great, great vote. Great. It's — as you know, it was a unanimous vote. How often do you see that? But the legislation passed by the Senate yesterday includes an additional $25 billion to further expand testing, and provides even more funding for community health centers and various forms of epidemics and pandemics. And we'll be working on that because, you know, as per a couple of your statements and questions before, we want to work on that for the future."
210,2020-04-05,"We hope this doesn't happen again for — again, ever. But, you know, last time it was of this magnitude: 1917. That's a long time ago. So we want to be prepared. And we are prepared."
211,2020-04-05,"And, as I told you, we're building up hospital — not only our stockpile, which is being up greatly — being built up greatly — but also hospital stockpiles. We're getting them what they need. We're working out cost arrangements with them. And we're getting them a lot of the ventilators, which are the hardest thing for them to get, both from a cost standpoint and a technical standpoint."
212,2020-04-05,"At the same time, we're also supporting the establishment of new testing sites focused on these communities. Forty sites have launched so far, and there are plans to launch dozens more in the next three weeks. We're — we're coming up with testing apparatus and testing plans that are incredible when you look at the numbers. And some people are very, very big on testing. I'm big on testing, but some people are much less big than I am, I will tell you, and they're professionals. But we want to have it so that nobody can talk about, “Gee whiz, I wish we had more testing.”"
213,2020-04-05,"Nobody has done it like we've done it, and nobody will. And we're getting very much stronger. We have incredible professionals doing it. So many different tests have now evolved, people are finding it even hard to believe."
214,2020-04-05,"My administration is working closely with governors to ensure that they have the testing infrastructure in place to reduce further spread of the virus if they're so inclined to use the testing apparatus, including strategies for older individuals, low-income Americans, minorities, and Native Americans."
215,2020-04-05,"As part of the effort, the White House Task Force, headed up by Mike, who has done incredible — I'll say it every time. I'll say it to anybody that wants to listen: Mike Pence has done an incredible job. Really, an incredible job. Thank you. Is providing technical assistance to all 50 states through one-on-one phone calls as they develop and implement their plans."
216,2020-04-05,"In addition, my administration is committed to restoring black and Hispanic communities to full economic health. They want to be healthy, economically and physically, and that's what we're doing."
217,2020-04-05,"To that end, today I'm directing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, led by Secretary Ben Carson, to focus its effort on supporting underserved communities impacted by the coronavirus. And so Ben Carson is working on that with Mike and myself and a lot of other people. I'm going to ask Tim Scott, who was so helpful with the Opportunity Zones. That's an economic answer to a lot of problems. And Tim Scott was fantastic, and so I'm going to ask him to get involved with you. And I'm sure he'll be willing to do it from South Carolina."
218,2020-04-05,"I also asked the council to identify what additional funding will be required from Congress beyond what has already been provided. We're really building ourself a strong base and we're building ourself a wall that's very different from the kind of walls that you've been hearing me talking about. But it nevertheless, in many ways, performs the same function. And hopefully it's going to perform it equally as well."
219,2020-04-05,"Furthermore, the council will seek input from the private sector and community leaders on how we can best support minority and distressed communities."
220,2020-04-05,"As President, I'm absolutely determined to deliver a great future for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Before our nation was attacked by this horrible enemy, our African American and Hispanic American citizens were prospering like never before. Best employment numbers ever. Not only African American, Asian American, Hispanic American — every American. We were breaking records at every level. We had almost 160 million people employed. We were never even close to that number. And we're also breaking them economically — highest stock market numbers, highest numbers of every kind. And I think we're going to be back there, and I think it's going to be much sooner rather than later. And I think we'll surpass those numbers, including our employment numbers."
221,2020-04-05,"But I'll not rest until that prosperity has been fully restored. And, again, I really believe that we're going to lift those numbers higher than ever before. And it won't be as long as people might think. A lot of very smart people are looking at that and they're betting. You just have to look at what's going on with the stock market."
222,2020-04-05,"In order to protect our great American workers, I've just signed an executive order temporarily suspending immigration into the United States. This will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens. Crucially, it will also preserve our healthcare resources for American patients. We have to take care of our patients, we have to take care of our great American workers, and that's what we're doing."
223,2020-04-05,"So I've just signed it, just before coming into the room. And very important, very important. And as to amending it or extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time. But it's now signed."
224,2020-04-05,"Earlier today, the First Lady and I planted a tree on the South Lawn of the White House in recognition of the 50th annual Earth Day. I was glad to announce that we will begin to reopen our national parks and public lands. We want Americans to be able to satisfy and be really safe. We want them to satisfy their family that safety is going to happen. And it will happen, and maybe even at a level like never before. We've learned so much. But we want them to enjoy these great national treasures as we continue to take reasonable precautions. And hopefully, it'll be just reasonable."
225,2020-04-05,"My administration has directed more than $7 billion in federal funding to support the development of treatments, diagnostics, and therapies. And that's something, Doctors, I hope you can really work on. It's something so powerful and so important."
226,2020-04-05,"The FDA, the NIH, and industry leaders are establishing master clinical trial protocols to test multiple promising new drugs at the same time. And they're doing a lot of — we're doing a lot of testing right now."
227,2020-04-05,"More than 1,600 locations across the country have signed up to administer convalescent plasma to patients, infusing them with antibodies of those who have recovered. And when they recover — I said it last time — practically, the first thing they say is, “I want to give my blood so that I can help other people.” They want to give their blood. It's incredible. They're laying in bed, they're still in pretty weakened conditions, and they say, “I want to give my blood.” And that's happening all the time, isn't it? If you recovered from the coronavirus, I ask you to consider contacting your local blood or plasma donation center to arrange a donation that could potentially save many lives."
228,2020-04-05,"With love for our nation and loyalty for our fellow citizens, we will safeguard our families, care for our neighbors, heal the sick, protect our workers, and build a future for a country that is the greatest country anywhere in the world. And we're only going to get greater."
229,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Mike Pence, please."
230,2020-04-05,Great.
231,2020-04-05,"Okay. Go ahead, please."
232,2020-04-05,"Well, we could talk about that later. It's an executive order on immigration. We want Americans to have the jobs. We want Americans to have the healthcare. We want to take care of our citizens first. We have to. And it's a very powerful order. It's for 60 days. At the end of 60 days, or maybe even during 60 days, I'll extend it or not. And I'll maybe change it. I might modify it."
233,2020-04-05,Yes.
234,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead, please."
235,2020-04-05,"We're talking about immigrants that are trying to get in, and we're talking about people and — also, by the way, people that are coming in illegally."
236,2020-04-05,"Now, as you know, because you've seen the numbers, our border — our southern border — is very, very tight. It hasn't been this tight in years. It's being helped by 160 — more than that — miles of wall that are going up. I'm trying to get to 450 by the end of the year — 450 miles."
237,2020-04-05,"And we'll have 530 miles early next year, and that's really great. It's fully funded. We have all the funds. And the Army Corps of Engineers is doing a fantastic job. Same people that did Javits Center, as you know. They're doing a fantastic job. So our — our southern border is very, very tight, for good reason — for very good reason."
238,2020-04-05,"We're also being helped by 27,000 very good soldiers from Mexico, and I want to thank the President of Mexico. He's been terrific in many ways, including on what we're doing with COVID. And, as you know, we have a very good trade arrangement with Mexico now, which we didn't have before. So I want to thank the President of Mexico, in particular for the 27,000 soldiers."
239,2020-04-05,They're doing — they're doing a fantastic job.
240,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we want to protect our healthcare workers, and that's one of the other reasons we're doing this."
241,2020-04-05,"Yes, Jon."
242,2020-04-05,I — I've never heard of him. You just mentioned the name. I never heard of him. When did this happen?
243,2020-04-05,"Well, I've never heard of him. If the guy says he was pushed out of a job, maybe he was, maybe he wasn't. I — you'd have to hear the other side. I don't know who he is."
244,2020-04-05,Please.
245,2020-04-05,"Hold on one second, please."
246,2020-04-05,Hope so.
247,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to probably have 25 percent of what we had last year. Last year, as you know, it was maxed out — maxed out. I saw a magnificent picture of Dr. Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year, and both of them were maxed out. It was beautiful to see. Beautiful. Very similar."
248,2020-04-05,"This year, most likely, we'll be standing six feet apart. We'll have to do that in a very, very interesting way. And maybe we'll even do it greater, so we'll leave a little extra distance. But if we do that, we'd certainly do that."
249,2020-04-05,— they've been for the last hundred years.
250,2020-04-05,"No, I know. But your stadiums — as an example, sports — are going to be the way they used to be. I mean, I told one of the owners. He said, “Do you think I should take out seats?” I said, “No, you shouldn't take out seats.” We're going to have it the way it was. We're going to be back."
251,2020-04-05,"This virus will eventually be gone. And if it should show up in the fall, we're going to put it out very fast. We have great people. We're going to put it out very fast, because we've learned a lot. We've learned a lot about how to deal with this, and we'll put it out very fast."
252,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
253,2020-04-05,Nice — just nice and easy. Just — good.
254,2020-04-05,Yeah.
255,2020-04-05,"Well, I am doing that."
256,2020-04-05,"And — and let me just say, we are the king of testing already. There's no country in the world that's done more. Not even — not even close."
257,2020-04-05,I just said there's no country in the world that's done more. And we have tests that have already come out that are going to be introduced very shortly that will do it more.
258,2020-04-05,"My problem is this: It's a — it's very much of media trap. Whether we did 2 percent, 5 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent, it'll never be enough, no matter what."
259,2020-04-05,"Now, with the — with the expertise and with what we did — because of our expertise and tremendous talent at manufacturing — what we did with the ventilators, that wasn't a trap. Because we got them done, shockingly to everybody, because of the incredible talent — like Mike Pence saw yesterday in Wisconsin. But we have numerous of those sites all over the country doing the same thing."
260,2020-04-05,"So that when the governors were complaining — some of the governors, I must say. And it was very much along party lines, for the most part, but when they — except for one. When the governors were complaining, we said, “No, no. How many do you need?” “We need 50.” “We need 100.” One governor asked for many, many, many thousands, and it turned out they didn't need that, and that's good. We got them and nobody that needed a ventilator — you know this, and we went through this with the governors — that needed a ventilator didn't get a ventilator. That was an incredible achievement."
261,2020-04-05,"With testing, it's a little different. It's much easier than ventilators. It's like 2 percent. But — for instance, the swabs are coming in by the millions. They're coming in — literally coming in by the millions. Totally ordered. We wanted the highest quality. We could have gotten a much lesser quality. We didn't want to do that. We got the highest quality."
262,2020-04-05,"But, testing — it's like no matter how well you do, you can always say more. With the ventilators, they either have them or they don't. In fact, we went to one meeting — “Who wants a ventilator?” One governor — one governor said, “We'd like 25.” “Twenty-five. You got them. Who else?” Nobody spoke up. That was four weeks ago. So that was great."
263,2020-04-05,"The problem with the testing is, as I said, if we test — if we tested 350 million people, you'll say, “Well, we want them to have a second test or a third test or a fourth test.”"
264,2020-04-05,"Not everybody believes as strongly as some people in testing. Some people want to do testing because they think it's impossible for us to fulfill that goal. That's easy compared to ventilators, as I've said. But we have a tremendous testing capability — better than anybody in the world right now. And every day, it's growing. And it's growing very substantial. I mean, these doctors are very talented people. They've seen testing all their lives. They've never seen anything like we've been able to do."
265,2020-04-05,"So, we're going to give everybody what they want with the testing. But again, testing — and I've said it from the beginning: The actual test has to be administered locally. You can't do from Washington or faraway locations — federal testing — nearly as well as you can, where you have a governor, he has mayors, and they have representatives, and — and they know the back of a Walmart — put it in the parking lot in the back of a Walmart or put it in a certain location in different states. They're doing it beautifully. It's working beautifully."
266,2020-04-05,"The relationship I have with the governors, and Mike has, and we all have with the governors, I would say, other than one or two — but even them, they don't complain. They're not complaining. So we're doing tremendous testing. And ultimately, we're doing more testing, I think, than probably any of the governors even want."
267,2020-04-05,"Okay. Please, Jennifer."
268,2020-04-05,It's green cards for — subject —
269,2020-04-05,"It's subject to change. We have some people coming in, for instance, helping the farmers. We want to have the farmers take care — they've been coming for years and years, and they're helping our farmers, and they've — they've been coming in for years."
270,2020-04-05,"We don't want to do — you know, the border has been turned off a number of times over the years. And you know what happened? Our farmers all went out of business. They were out of business. They couldn't farm. We're taking care of our farmers. Nobody ever took care of farmers like I take care of farmers."
271,2020-04-05,Including the $19 billion that we're dispersing to farmers because of some very good things that happened.
272,2020-04-05,"No, no. Just it might be modified. It could be modified next week, in two weeks. It could be modified in two months. No, we may modify it as we go along. But right now, we have a very powerful immigration ban, but it could be modified — meaning made tougher or made less tough. We don't want to hurt our businesses, and we don't want to hurt our farmers. Very important."
273,2020-04-05,"Look, I'd like them to listen to their governors. All of their governors. I have the right to do, if I wanted to clamp it down, but I have respect for our governors. They know what they're doing, I think. And, as you know, Brian Kemp, governor of Georgia, I worked very hard for his election. He beat their superstar. He beat the superstar of their party. I think you can say, I helped a lot."
274,2020-04-05,"Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey — they all went in. They campaigned for him very, very hard, and he lost. He also was way down in a primary, and he ended up winning a primary after I came out and endorsed him. So, a lot of good things and there's a lot of good feeling between myself and Brian Kemp. I like him a lot."
275,2020-04-05,"I happen to disagree with him only on time and timing. I disagree. When you have spas, beauty parlors — and I love these people — I know the people from spas and beauty parlors, tattoo parlors. Bikers for Trump — a lot of tattoos. I love them. I love these people. And barbershops. These are great people. But you know what? Maybe you wait a little bit longer until you get into a phase two."
276,2020-04-05,"So do I agree with him? No. But I respect him, and I will let him make his decision. Would I do that? No. I'd keep them a little longer. I want to protect people's lives. But I'm going to let him make his decision. But I told him: I totally disagree."
277,2020-04-05,Okay.
278,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Well, we're doing that automatically. I mean, that's almost common sense. But we're doing that automat- — I mean, you look at the State of Washington. That was our first glimpse of it. They got hit so horribly in that nursing home. It seems — it seemed like everybody was from a particular nursing home."
279,2020-04-05,"So we knew immediately that was going to be a problem. And we're doing that, 100 percent."
280,2020-04-05,"We're taking very special care of our nursing homes and our seniors, other than me. Other than me. Nobody wants to take care of me. But other than me, we're taking care of our seniors."
281,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please, Mike. Go ahead."
282,2020-04-05,How about right behind Jennifer? Go ahead.
283,2020-04-05,We'll get back — we'll get back to you.
284,2020-04-05,"Very easy. They can get new machines if they want, but even if they didn't, we have tremendous testing capability. You take a look at what's happening in California and New York. Governor Cuomo told us very strongly — he said, “Wow, we have a lot of labs.” You know, that's a research center of the world. They have tremendous — in California, too. Long conversations. They have tremendous testing capability there too. Now, if they want to increase it, they can increase it, but they have plenty right now."
285,2020-04-05,"You saw the maps the other day, when we put up the different sites in various states, and virtually all states are like that."
286,2020-04-05,How about you with the mask? Nice that you wear a mask.
287,2020-04-05,Who did the maps? Do you — do you want do that? Do you want to say something?
288,2020-04-05,"But without building new, they have tremendous capability. And —"
289,2020-04-05,And many of the governors were not aware that those laboratories were available.
290,2020-04-05,"Jon, you didn't know that was in the guidelines?"
291,2020-04-05,"No, but it's right — but it's right in the guidelines."
292,2020-04-05,I'm surprised at you.
293,2020-04-05,"Jerome, would you like to say something on that, please? Please."
294,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Jerome. Thank you. And I have to say our Surgeon General is doing a great job. Thank you."
295,2020-04-05,Great job. Really good.
296,2020-04-05,"No. We're covered — we're covered 100 percent. We don't want their gunboats surrounding our boats and traveling around our boats and having a good time. We don't want them anywhere near our boats. And — so you know the order I gave. I don't think I have to say it again, but I've given that order."
297,2020-04-05,"Under the Obama administration, it was taking place all the time. Under my administration, I gave this order early on and nothing happened. They were very nice; they were no problem. But then I noticed yesterday, they did that in a much lighter form, but they did that again. I said, “We're not going to — we're not going to stand for it.”"
298,2020-04-05,"So if they do that, that's putting our ships at danger and our great crews and sailors at — in danger. I'm not going to let that happen. And we will — they'll shoot them out of the water."
299,2020-04-05,"No, that's not rules of engagement; that's a threat when they get that close to our boat. And they have guns. They have very substantial weapons on those boats. But we'll shoot them out of the water. Okay?"
300,2020-04-05,Please.
301,2020-04-05,Pets.
302,2020-04-05,What about the lion in the New York Zoo?
303,2020-04-05,How did that — how did that happen?
304,2020-04-05,Yes.
305,2020-04-05,He did what? What?
306,2020-04-05,"That, I don't know. But I — you're just telling me something. And what's the second?"
307,2020-04-05,"No problem with face masks, if the governors want to do that. You know, we ordered — I don't know if you know — 500 million face masks. We have hundreds of millions right now. And if people want to wear them, it's up to the governors. If the governors want that, it's absolutely — now, it's more appropriate in some states, obviously, than others. You have the big plains and you have certain states where it's much less necessary."
308,2020-04-05,"But, no, that's up to the governors. And we have that very well covered, I think, face masks. But we have —"
309,2020-04-05,"We have hundreds of millions of face masks, and we have at least 500 million. That's a lot. We'll have them very shortly."
310,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know. Would anybody like to speak about it? I don't — I think, if — for — as — just so you understand, if somebody wants to wear them, I'm all for it. Would somebody like to discuss that?"
311,2020-04-05,"Jerome, please."
312,2020-04-05,"Yeah, but I'm right next to you, so. (Laughter.)"
313,2020-04-05,"No, I think it's (inaudible)."
314,2020-04-05,He's answered that question.
315,2020-04-05,"Just a wise-guy question, that's all."
316,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
317,2020-04-05,"You mean the shot they took? Well, they say no. Okay? They say all sorts. “It was for television”. Does anybody really believe that? They want to have better television in Iran, so they say."
318,2020-04-05,"No, we're watching Iran very closely. Very closely."
319,2020-04-05,"We know more about Iran than they do. Right now, we know more than they do. So we know all about it. We watched it; we knew it was going up. We followed it very closely. They say it was for television."
320,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
321,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. Finish up there, please."
322,2020-04-05,See what? What is vulnerable?
323,2020-04-05,"Her, I read where various navies have had outbreaks of COVID. Look, we're in 184 different — different nations right now. A hundred and eight-four — the COVID."
324,2020-04-05,"No, we have a problem on — that just shows you how rapidly it spreads. It started off with two sailors and then 10 sailors and 20, and now I hear it's 540, of which one has died and a few are very sick. But most of them are back in — you know, in great shape. But we did — we did lose one, and it attacked the lungs of that young person. And then we also had a number of that were quite sick, but they're all either better or getting better. But most of them are better for a long time already."
325,2020-04-05,"Okay, please."
326,2020-04-05,"Yeah, just one second."
327,2020-04-05,Yeah.
328,2020-04-05,Yeah.
329,2020-04-05,"Look at South Dakota, how well the governor is — yeah, look at South Dakota, how well the governor has done there. And, all of a sudden, you have a big spike in one location. And she's got that very much under control, as you know. But nevertheless, that was surprising. And they had a big one right near where you were yesterday, as I understand it. And — so yeah, we're concerned about that."
330,2020-04-05,"They're closing one or two of the plants, actually."
331,2020-04-05,"Yeah, totally secure. It's in great shape."
332,2020-04-05,"Yeah, in the back. You didn't go."
333,2020-04-05,Against China.
334,2020-04-05,Yeah.
335,2020-04-05,"Well, I haven't seen the case. I know about the case. He filed a case against China. I love Missouri, as you know. It's great. But I'm going to take a look at it. I actually know about it very much. I have to take a look at it. I have not seen the case, in terms of reading it, but I will be doing that."
336,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to have to take a look. Oh, we're doing investigations. We're doing our own. But I do want to see and review that lawsuit. I'm sure that won't be the last one."
337,2020-04-05,Yeah.
338,2020-04-05,"Yeah, sure."
339,2020-04-05,"And why did you say that he has great gifts or gifts? What, do you know him?"
340,2020-04-05,"No, no, but have you reviewed him? Have you — have you studied him? Have you reported on him? You said, “his gifts.” His gifts. I mean —"
341,2020-04-05,"Well, that doesn't mean you have gifts. I know a lot of people, they play baseball, but they can't hit 150 in the Major Leagues."
342,2020-04-05,"No, no, but you talk about his great gifts."
343,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
344,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead. You can go. Please."
345,2020-04-05,From where? From where?
346,2020-04-05,And they didn't want to say what? What does that mean? Tell me.
347,2020-04-05,What does it mean? Repeat it. Say it a little differently.
348,2020-04-05,"Oh, really? That's interest- — is he a Democrat?"
349,2020-04-05,"Well, check it. How can you ask that questions without knowing?"
350,2020-04-05,Check it out. You'll find out.
351,2020-04-05,"Okay, what's the next question?"
352,2020-04-05,How would he know what I felt? I never spoke to him. I don't even know who he is.
353,2020-04-05,You don't know who he is either.
354,2020-04-05,"Okay, it doesn't help me, and it doesn't help you."
355,2020-04-05,"Okay, go ahead, Jeff."
356,2020-04-05,Do we want to keep going a little while longer or no?
357,2020-04-05,"You're not going to say, “Oh, he took questions all night long”?"
358,2020-04-05,Okay? Right?
359,2020-04-05,"Okay, well, good. How many questions can you ask? Go ahead."
360,2020-04-05,"We — we all have fun, because we're talking about something very important."
361,2020-04-05,"The main thing is I think we're getting to a lot of solutions. We never want this to happen again. We never want this to happen again — what happened. And if it should come back in some form, we want to snuff it out very quickly before anything can happen."
362,2020-04-05,"And I personally hope it doesn't come back in the fall as a combination of the flu or not as a combination of the flu. But I think we learned a lot. And, you know, some of these questions are good. Some of them are ridiculous, frankly, but some of them are very — I think some of them are very important questions. Very important. You know, when you asked Dr. Fauci about the right to speak — if I let him speak, I'll let anybody speak. And we love him."
363,2020-04-05,Let's go.
364,2020-04-05,I — I heard he said that.
365,2020-04-05,I don't know — I don't know what he said. I'll have to call him and ask him.
366,2020-04-05,"Well, that's okay. I'm going to have to look at it directly."
367,2020-04-05,"I can't tell you that. I have to see — I want to base it on fact and reason. I want to see what he said — you know, why he said it and how he said it. I'd have to watch him say it. But some of the states are not doing well, let's face it. And some are doing phenomenally well. A state where Mike was governor, Indiana — I looked at their numbers. They have — it's incredible what they're doing."
368,2020-04-05,"Some states are doing fantastically well. Iowa is doing great. You have — you have states doing well, and you have some states that aren't doing well. We know the ones. I don't have to mention the ones that aren't doing well, but you do have states that are in trouble. And certainly they're coming back to talk to us. We'll see what happens."
369,2020-04-05,"Well, we have a choice. Do we have a choice? Yeah. I'm always concerned about everything. We had to fix this problem. This was — we were attacked. This was an attack. This wasn't just, “Oh, gee.”"
370,2020-04-05,"And this wasn't the flu, by the way. You know, they like to say the flu. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. 1917 was the last time. We were attacked. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had the greatest economy — better than China, better than any place. They will tell you that. I dealt with them for a long time, and they will tell — we have the greatest economy and we built it in the last three years, three and a half years we built it."
371,2020-04-05,"And then one day, they came and they said, “You have to close it.” I said, “You got to be...” “These people right here, they said you have to...” They came into my office — into the Oval Office, and they said, “We have to close the economy.” I said, “Let's explain this. Explain this to me.” The greatest ever in history and we had to close it."
372,2020-04-05,"Now we're going to open it again, and we're going to be just as strong or stronger. But you have to spend some money to get it back open. We saved our airlines. We just, as you know, finished up with the airlines. We saved numerous companies — that are great companies — that, two months ago, were having the best year they've ever had. Now, all of a sudden, they're totally shut out of markets."
373,2020-04-05,"There was a great spirit today. You know, the fact is some of the governors are opening up their states. And I saw it. I feel it. I don't know if you folks feel it. I feel it. There was a great spirit today. I don't know, the stock market was up today, I guess. It was up quite a bit when I just walked out here."
374,2020-04-05,"And I will say I feel much different today than I did two or three days ago, and I think the world does. We spoke to a lot of leaders. The world feels that we're really leading a path of optimism. The European Union is having a lot of difficulty. You know, you take a look at what's going on with the European Union; it's having tremendous difficulty."
375,2020-04-05,"But we're going to be back, and we're going to be back stronger than ever. We're going to be at a level, I think, that everybody is going to be look — and they do; they look up to us. They want to know what are we doing. What are we doing with therapeutics? What are we doing with vaccines? We're going to have those answers too. We're going to have them, just like we took care of ventilators, just like we're taking care of — and, already, as we said 100 times, we had more testing than any nation in the world. We had more testing than all of those nations put together that we mentioned the other day — all of them put together. And we're going to be, within two weeks, at a level that nobody has ever even seen before."
376,2020-04-05,"They've never seen where we are right now. You don't have to build new machines. You don't have to build new labs; we already have them. But some of the labs are even upgrading to be able to double and triple their capacity, in one case. No, we're at a level that nobody has ever been. We're going to be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. So I'm not concerned about that."
377,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
378,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Later this evening, we expect the House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. I'm grateful that Congress is answering my call to deliver these additional $320 billion in relief for the American worker and for small businesses."
379,2020-04-05,"At a time when many Americans are enduring significant economic challenges, this bill will help small businesses to keep millions of workers on the payroll. You see states are starting to open up now, and it's very exciting to see. I think it's very awe-inspiring. We're coming out of it, and we're coming out of it well."
380,2020-04-05,"And we're — really, I'm very happy the governors have been — the governors, really, have been doing a really good job working with us, and it's — it's, really, pretty impressive to see. I've spoken to numerous leaders of countries over the last 48 hours, and they are saying we're leading the way. We're really leading the way in so many different ways."
381,2020-04-05,"I'm also very pleased that Harvard — as you know, it's Harvard and Stanford and Princeton and numerous other universities and colleges, and also large businesses have sent funds back to us. And in some cases, I stopped funds that I looked at. And we are pleased to report that the funds have either not gone out or it's about $350 million, and they've either not gone out or we've renegotiated it and they're not getting them."
382,2020-04-05,"So — and it's — in a couple of cases, they're sending them back and sending them back immediately. So I think it was very nice. I want to thank Harvard in particular. They acted very quickly and decisively. And they agreed, when they heard the facts, that they should not be getting it. So we appreciate it very much from Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and other institutions."
383,2020-04-05,"The bill also includes $30 billion to support small lending institutions serving distressed communities, helping countless African American and Hispanic American small businesses."
384,2020-04-05,"As we continue our battle against the virus, the data and facts on the ground suggest that we're making great progress. In 23 states, new cases have declined in the peak — week. Forty percent of American counties have also seen a rapid decline in new cases. Forty-six states reported drop in patients showing coronavirus-like symptoms. That's a big number."
385,2020-04-05,"To keep America gaining momentum, every citizen needs to maintain the vigilance. And we all understand that very well; we've gone over it many, many times. This includes practicing good hygiene, maintaining social distance, and the voluntary use of face covering."
386,2020-04-05,"A safe and phased reopening of our economy — it's very exciting, but it does not mean that we are letting down our guard at all, in any way. On the contrary, continued diligence is an essential part of our strategy to get our country back to work, to take our country back. We're winning this, and we're going to win it, and we're going to keep watching. We're going to watch very closely for the invisible enemy."
387,2020-04-05,"With each passing day, we're learning more and more about this enemy. The scientists at DHS have released a report offering a number of insights about how the virus reacts to different temperatures, climates, and surfaces. The findings confirm that the virus survives better in cold or in drier environments and does less well in warmer and more humid environments."
388,2020-04-05,"I have to say that, very excitingly, we're going to have somebody up; Bill will be up in just a little while. It was a great report you gave. And he's going to be talking about how the virus reacts in sunlight. Wait until you hear the numbers. You won't even believe them."
389,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Bill."
390,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Bill."
391,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. So I asked Bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of, if you're totally into that world, which I find to be very interesting. So, supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light — and I think you said that that hasn't been checked, but you're going to test it. And then I said, supposing you brought the light inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way, and I think you said you're going to test that too. It sounds interesting."
392,2020-04-05,"Right. And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds — it sounds interesting to me."
393,2020-04-05,"So we'll see. But the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute, that's — that's pretty powerful."
394,2020-04-05,"Steve, please."
395,2020-04-05,"Well, we may, and we may go beyond that. We're going to have to see where it is. And I think people are going to know. You're going to know. I'm going to know. I think people are going to know just out of common sense. At some point, we won't have to do that. But until we feel it's safe, we're going to be extending."
396,2020-04-05,"Yeah, but it means we're going to watch those cases very carefully. I think we've all gotten very good at it. We've gotten good at tracing. We see where the cases are, where they're going, and we're going to be watching it. And it's called “containment.” At a certain point, we're going to be able to contain."
397,2020-04-05,"And, you know, when you see this, a lot of people have been talking about summer. Maybe this is one of the reasons. We've — I once mentioned that maybe it does go away with heat and light. And people didn't like that statement very much. The — the fake news didn't like it at all. And I just threw it out as a suggestion, but it seems like that's the case, because when it's on a surface that would last for a long time, when that surface is outside, it goes away very quickly. It dies very quickly with the sun."
398,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead."
399,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we'll look into it, and I have been looking into it. I've been talking to a lot of the different senators, but I don't want to talk about it now. That was a very interesting presentation."
400,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Jon."
401,2020-04-05,I just told you I'm not talking about it now.
402,2020-04-05,I'll talk about it later.
403,2020-04-05,"I'd like to talk about something that, right now, is of more interest to people."
404,2020-04-05,Yeah. Sure.
405,2020-04-05,"It wouldn't be through injection. We're talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't work. But it certainly has a big effect if it's on a stationary object."
406,2020-04-05,"But so are you saying, on surfaces, the heat, the hot summer, and whatever other conditions — humidity and lack of humidity — that that would have an impact so that on surfaces, where it can be picked up, it will die fairly quickly in the summer, whereas in the winter, it wouldn't die so quickly?"
407,2020-04-05,"If it's on somebody's hands, right?"
408,2020-04-05,And they haven't touched their face and all of the things that we've all been —
409,2020-04-05,"I know, but if they're outside — right — and their hands are exposed to the sun, will that kill it as though it were on a piece of metal or something else?"
410,2020-04-05,"This is sort of semi-non-porous, right? This, right?"
411,2020-04-05,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, go ahead."
412,2020-04-05,"In fact, I'm thinking about moving outside to the Rose Garden. (Laughter.) No, it's a very interesting question, actually."
413,2020-04-05,"Okay. Please, go ahead. In the back."
414,2020-04-05,Phil?
415,2020-04-05,"And we are working with other countries on vaccines, as you know."
416,2020-04-05,Yeah. Go ahead. Please.
417,2020-04-05,Say it? In the beginning — what?
418,2020-04-05,"Well, I'll tell you one thing: I think a lot of people are going to go outside all of a sudden. People that didn't want to go outside, they'll be going."
419,2020-04-05,"This was a — to me this is very — really, a very interesting meeting. We covered it in great detail. And these are incredible people at that — we could call it a laboratory, because that's essentially what it is. It's a super laboratory. It's a lot of things going on in that laboratory."
420,2020-04-05,A lot of very interesting things going on in that laboratory.
421,2020-04-05,Yeah.
422,2020-04-05,"Sure, Mike. Go ahead. Go ahead."
423,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
424,2020-04-05,Okay. Yeah. Go ahead.
425,2020-04-05,I haven't at all. I haven't at all. What are you say- — we'll see what happens.
426,2020-04-05,"We've had a lot of very good results and we had some results that perhaps aren't so good. I don't know. I just read about one, but I also read many times good. So I haven't at all. And it's a — it's a great — for malaria, for lupus, for other things. And we'll see what it is."
427,2020-04-05,"But, I guess, Deborah, they have many, many studies going on on that. So we'll — we'll be able to learn."
428,2020-04-05,I have not. I haven't seen it. I have not seen it.
429,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
430,2020-04-05,Yeah. Yeah.
431,2020-04-05,"Well, I know a lot about economists."
432,2020-04-05,Yeah.
433,2020-04-05,Sure.
434,2020-04-05,"Well, let me go. We — we know the rest of the question, right? So I — I know a lot about economists, and the answer is they have no idea. I think I have as good an idea as anybody, and I think our economy will start to pick up very substantially, as soon as the states get open."
435,2020-04-05,"And that's happening as we speak, and it's actually very exciting, and people are just — just thrilled to see it, because our country has to get back to work. They want to get back to work. You see that, whether it's a demonstration or just in talking to people. They're going to get back to work, and they're going to get back to work very fast."
436,2020-04-05,"States are advanced. I look at Gavin Newson — was — Newsom was very nice today. He wrote a beautiful statement about — we sent him a lot of — a lot of things that he needed. Okay? Things — different things that he needed. We got — we got it taken care of. They've done very well in California, as you know. They're doing really well in Florida. They're doing well in a lot of places. New York and New Jersey got hit very hard. They're doing very well."
437,2020-04-05,"I spoke again with Governor Cuomo, with Governor Murphy. They're doing — they're doing a great job. And here's the thing: We have to see. They got hit hard. Everyone close together — tight in. People don't realize New Jersey is very tight. You realize that because you've been covering it for a long time, but very tight. New York obviously is very tight. They're doing a terrific job."
438,2020-04-05,"The answer is yes. And the answer is — as you know, and as I've said many times — we're very advanced in testing. Other countries are calling us to find out what are we doing."
439,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, within two weeks, you'll see numbers and you'll see different forms of testing — just like we came up with the Abbott Laboratories machine, which gives it to you in five minutes — that everybody wants. Everybody is asking, “Can we get that?” But you can only make them so fast. But, as you know, we've done more testing than every other nation combined, and that's a big statement."
440,2020-04-05,"And, you know, when they talk about different tests and different things, we're also a bigger nation than most. And so, when they look at statistics — because, statistically, we're doing phenomenally, in terms of mortality, in terms of all of the different elements that you can judge. When you look, Germany and ourselves are doing very well."
441,2020-04-05,"We are very accurate in the reporting of numbers. In fact, I'll go a step further. As you know, in New York, they actually added quite a few deaths to a list that was done in New York. And they added a number of deaths. We're very, very — highly accurate."
442,2020-04-05,"And then you'll look at certain lists of other countries. Some are so obvious just to look at, where obviously the number is ridiculous, in the form of low, because they're not accurate counts. They're not even close to accurate counts. In fact, they're insulting to look at them."
443,2020-04-05,"So we've done very well. Again, testing — we're doing very well on testing. We've tested far more than anybody else anywhere in the world. And within a short period of time, you'll be hearing about new tests that are coming out that are going to be incredible."
444,2020-04-05,"Steve, go ahead."
445,2020-04-05,"No, I don't agree with him on that. No, I think we're doing a great job in testing. I don't agree. If he said that, I don't agree with him."
446,2020-04-05,Yes.
447,2020-04-05,"Yeah, well, they're doing it. I'll tell you, Steve, they — they're doing it at a level that they've never done it before. Abbott is a great company. It's a very big, highly respected company. They came up with this machine where you do it — I've done it both ways. I've done it this way and I didn't like it. And I've done it the Abbott way, where you literally just touch and, five minutes later, you know the answer."
448,2020-04-05,"And we use them in the White House. I think you folks have been given that opportunity, which is much more pleasant than the first way that they looked at you. Right?"
449,2020-04-05,"We're making them — hundreds of thousands of machines. The advantage to the other tests and the laboratory tests is we can get millions and millions of those tests done. It takes a day or two days. But — you know, because it's really a delivery situation, more than anything else. The test itself goes quickly once it gets to the laboratory."
450,2020-04-05,"But as we have found and as we have, I think, shown everybody in the room, we have many laboratories. We have thou- — we have so many laboratories. Nobody — nobody — a lot of the governors did not know that we have this capacity, but we have many laboratories all over our country. Every state has laboratories and some have a lot of them. So I think we will — we will come up with things as time goes by."
451,2020-04-05,"Again, when I started, we ended up — we — we started with nothing, essentially. What — we started with a broken test, a test that didn't work. We started with a test that did very few people, not millions of people."
452,2020-04-05,"The problem is, if we did 350- — if we did 350 million tests, one for each person, the media would say, “Oh, you should have done two for each person.” No matter what you do, it doesn't make any difference."
453,2020-04-05,It's just like the ventilators. I talk about it all the time. Nobody ever mentions ventilators. One of the hardest things are ventilators. And now we're making thousands a week — thousands of ventilators. And they're calling from Mexico; they're calling from many countries.
454,2020-04-05,"I've received today four calls. “Would it be possible to send ventilators?” Right? I got four calls today. I got three calls yesterday. No country is equipped like we are. We have 11 — we have 11 different places making ventilators. Our country, as you know, doesn't need them now. Our governors are very happy."
455,2020-04-05,"But that's different than test, because with a test you can always say, “Oh, we — we need more.” No, I think we've done incredibly well with — obviously, with ventilators. We're — we also have 500 million masks — 500 million masks that are very shortly going to be here. We've made millions of masks. We have ordered millions of masks that have arrived and been distributed."
456,2020-04-05,"We gave one hospital in New York City 300,000 masks. Before the virus, they were using 10,000. And now we got them 300,000, and they got rid of them very quick, which I — quickly — which I sort of say, “How did that happen? Why?” Because they became very valuable — the masks. I say, “How did that happen?”"
457,2020-04-05,"But we got — we have — we've done an amazing job, and we've worked with the governors. And when the governors weren't able — again, they're the first line — when they weren't able to get something — like ventilators, they couldn't get ventilators. They could've bought them. You could have bought them, but most of them — many of them chose not to. So they all needed ventilators. We got the job done."
458,2020-04-05,"We have — I'll be introducing the team when we're finished with this whole nightmare, this whole curse, this whole plague. But the team that worked on the ventilators was incredible. And the team that work — and it's a little bit interchangeable, but the team that's working on the testing is truly an incredible team. These are brilliant people. And they're doing it for the country; they're not doing it for other reasons."
459,2020-04-05,Some have been very successful. They're doing it for the country.
460,2020-04-05,Yes.
461,2020-04-05,Great.
462,2020-04-05,I'll be signing it probably tonight.
463,2020-04-05,"I don't know if it was a vicious attack, but certainly some people do look at it that way. I've spoken to Mitch about it; I've spoken to numerous senators about it. And we're working with senators that are on the other side of the issue, and we'll see what happens. But we're looking to do what's right for the people of this country. We're looking to do what's right for a particular state. And we'll see what happens."
464,2020-04-05,"But it's certainly the next thing we're going to be discussing because some states have — in all fairness, Jon, some states have not done very well for many years, long before the virus came. You know, you can't blame the plague — this horrible plague that came in and, all of a sudden — you know, they can't blame that. You look at Illinois — he's got a lot of problems long before the virus came in. And so we'll be talking about it. It'll be a subject for a period of time."
465,2020-04-05,"And right now, we've — we've made this incredible deal for the workers and for small business. And I'm very happy that Harvard didn't get covered. We actually never sent them the check. But they were very nice about it. We never sent them the money. The old-fashioned way is the check; the new way is send them the money. And we didn't send them the money."
466,2020-04-05,"And — but they were very understanding and they were very nice about it. So was Princeton, so was Stanford, so were a number of other schools that you just don't associate with this money. So were big companies, as you know. You know, many of them. It was a relatively small amount of money compared to the whole. A very small amount of money compared. But we want it to be fair. We want it to go to the people that it's supposed to go to."
467,2020-04-05,I'm open. I'm open.
468,2020-04-05,I'm open to ideas that are going to be great for the people of this country.
469,2020-04-05,"And if we can help states, we're always going to help states."
470,2020-04-05,"Now, there's different ways of helping states. Some ways are better than others. So we're looking. It is interesting that the states that are in trouble do happen to be blue. It is interesting, you know, if you look around. I mean, the states that seem to have the problem happen to be Democrat."
471,2020-04-05,"No, but New York and New Jersey were in a lot of trouble long before the plague came. I mean, they were — you know, they had a lot of problems long before the plague came. I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it, spoke to Governor Murphy about it. I spoke with Gavin Newsom about it. And we — I'm speaking to a lot of people about it, because it's probably going to be the next thing on the list."
472,2020-04-05,"A lot of people understand very well what Mitch is saying, and they also understand the other side of the — the problem. And I'll be speaking about it. We're going to do the right thing for our country. The right thing for our country and the right thing for a lot of great people. Okay?"
473,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
474,2020-04-05,"Yeah, here we go."
475,2020-04-05,"Here we go. The new — the new headline is: “Trump Asks People to go Outside. That's Dangerous.” Here we go. Same old group. You ready? I hope people enjoy the sun. And if it has an impact, that's great. I'm just hearing this — not really for the first time. I mean, there's been a rumor that — you know, a very nice rumor — that you go outside in the sun, or you have heat and it does have an effect on other viruses."
476,2020-04-05,"But now we get it from one of the great laboratories of the world. I have to say, it covers a lot more territory than just this. This is — this is probably an easy thing, relatively speaking, for you."
477,2020-04-05,"I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure. You know — but if you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can't. Again, I say, maybe you can, maybe you can't. I'm not a doctor. But I'm like a person that has a good you know what."
478,2020-04-05,"Deborah, have you ever heard of that? The heat and the light, relative to certain viruses, yes, but relative to this virus?"
479,2020-04-05,Yeah.
480,2020-04-05,"I think it's a great thing to look at. I mean, you know. Okay?"
481,2020-04-05,"Hey — hey, Phil."
482,2020-04-05,"Hey, Phil. I'm the President and you're fake news. And you know what I'll say to you? I'll say it very nicely. I know you well."
483,2020-04-05,I know you well.
484,2020-04-05,Because I know the guy; I see what he writes. He's a total faker.
485,2020-04-05,"So, are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? It's just a suggestion from a brilliant lab by a very, very smart, perhaps brilliant, man. He's talking about sun. He's talking about heat. And you see the numbers. So that's it; that's all I have. I'm just here to present talent. I'm here to present ideas, because we want ideas to get rid of this thing. And if heat is good and if sunlight is good, that's a great thing as far as I'm concerned."
486,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
487,2020-04-05,They could have one of what?
488,2020-04-05,Yeah.
489,2020-04-05,Oxford is one. Johnson &amp; Johnson is working. They're also working together. You have many companies working together on a vaccine.
490,2020-04-05,"Oh, we'll scale it up. If we had a vaccine, it'll be scaled up very quickly. In fact, some of the companies — Johnson &amp; Johnson is one — is scaling up already, before they have the final answer. A number of companies are doing that. You'll save a lot of time. The normal is you scale up after."
491,2020-04-05,"I have to say, the FDA has been fantastic. Stephen Hahn — Dr. Hahn — has been fantastic. They're moving along rapidly. Rapidly."
492,2020-04-05,"No, I don't want to put a timescale because then the — the media, the so-called — so-called “media” — “lamestream” media will say, “He said a time.” I don't want to say times, because every time I say a time, if you don't hit it, they'll say — so I don't want to talk about time."
493,2020-04-05,But I will say that there's been tremendous progress made over the last month.
494,2020-04-05,Yeah.
495,2020-04-05,I did.
496,2020-04-05,I did.
497,2020-04-05,"He called me a few days ago. I will tell you, he sounded incredible. I was actually surprised. I thought he'd be like, “Oh, Donald, how are you...” He was ready to go. I could — I'm very surprised to tell you this: It's like the old Boris. Tremendous energy. Tremendous drive. I was very surprised, because he called me almost, you know, pretty close to when he got out of the hospital."
498,2020-04-05,I think he's doing great. I think he's doing great. He was so sharp and energetic. Pretty incredible. He's an incredible guy.
499,2020-04-05,He's a friend of ours and — and a friend of mine. He loves our country. He loves his country a lot. But he loves our country. He respects our country. And they're lucky to have him over there.
500,2020-04-05,Please.
501,2020-04-05,I hope he's not in medical trouble.
502,2020-04-05,I hope he's —
503,2020-04-05,"I've gotten along very well with him. And you know, here we are. You would have been in a war with North Korea if I didn't get elected President. Remember, I was going to be the one that took us into war, with my first day in office. Okay? Here we are. Look at what's happened. Withdrawal. We're bringing people home. We're not going to serve as policemen all over the world. I don't want to be policemen all over the world."
504,2020-04-05,And yet I've rebuilt our military to a level that it's never been built at before.
505,2020-04-05,But it's never recognized by the fake news.
506,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
507,2020-04-05,"Uh, I think the report was incorrect. Let me just put it that way. I think the report was done by a network that was incorrect."
508,2020-04-05,I'm hearing they used old documents. But I — that's what I hear. I hear the report was an incorrect report. I hope it was an incorrect report.
509,2020-04-05,I don't want to say.
510,2020-04-05,Yeah.
511,2020-04-05,With who?
512,2020-04-05,I don't want to say. I won't say that.
513,2020-04-05,"We have a good relationship with North Korea — as good as you can have. I mean, we have a good relationship with North Korea. I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, and I hope he's okay. And somebody would say, “Oh, that's terrible.” No, it's not terrible. I hope he's okay. And I think it was a fake report done by CNN."
514,2020-04-05,What do you have? Go ahead.
515,2020-04-05,"No, that's enough."
516,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
517,2020-04-05,"The problem is you don't write the truth, so, you know, as far as I'm concerned —"
518,2020-04-05,— I want to go — I want to go to the next question.
519,2020-04-05,"No, not CNN, please."
520,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
521,2020-04-05,You don't —
522,2020-04-05,I told you —
523,2020-04-05,— CNN is fake news. Don't talk to me.
524,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
525,2020-04-05,"Okay, next question."
526,2020-04-05,"Just ask one, please."
527,2020-04-05,About what?
528,2020-04-05,The controversy?
529,2020-04-05,I did.
530,2020-04-05,I had a good talk with the governor of Georgia.
531,2020-04-05,"I did convey the message. I didn't like the fact that he's leaving certain things — I want the states to open more than he does — much more than he does. But I didn't like to see spas at this early stage, nor did the doctors. Is that a correct statement, Deborah?"
532,2020-04-05,"I didn't like to see spas opening, frankly. I didn't like to see a lot of things happening. And I wasn't happy with it. And I wasn't happy with Brian Kemp. I wasn't at all happy, because — and I could have done something about it if I wanted to, but I'm saying let the governors do it. But I wasn't happy with Brian Kemp. Spas, beauty parlors, tattoo parlors — no, that's — that —"
533,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, I want them to open — excuse me."
534,2020-04-05,"Excuse me. I want them to open, and I want him to open as soon as possible. And I want the state to open. But I wasn't happy with Brian Kemp. I will tell you that right now."
535,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead."
536,2020-04-05,"No, he didn't. No, he didn't defy me at all. That's your language. He didn't defy me."
537,2020-04-05,"You know what happened? I said, “You make your own decision.” I told him that. I said, “You're not in the guidelines, but I'm letting you make your own decision. But I want people to be safe, and I want the people in Georgia to be safe, and I don't want this thing to flare up because you're deciding to do something that is not in the guidelines.”"
538,2020-04-05,"And I went to Deborah and Dr. Fauci and other people, and they weren't thrilled about it. And I could have stopped him, but I decided — and we all agreed — they got to watch it closely. So we'll see what happens."
539,2020-04-05,"I told him very distinctly — I said — Mike was there — I said, “You do what you think is best.” But if you ask me, am I happy about it? I'm not happy about it, and I'm not happy about Brian Kemp."
540,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
541,2020-04-05,"If we do it quickly, that would be great."
542,2020-04-05,"Because you see it in the charts. I mean, you have to ask the question, but you do see it in the charts."
543,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
544,2020-04-05,"Yeah, that's a — that's a problem."
545,2020-04-05,"Look, I can't tell you what's going to happen in an election."
546,2020-04-05,Yeah. Great question. I can't tell you what's going to happen. We have a sleepy guy in a basement of a house that the press is giving a free pass to who doesn't want to do debates because of COVID. And lots of things are happening. Right?
547,2020-04-05,"And I watched a couple of interviews, and I say, “Oh, I look forward to this.” But they're keeping him sheltered because of the coronavirus. And he's not moving around; he's not moving too much. And then I watch what the press does to the Republican Party — and to me, in particular."
548,2020-04-05,"We had the greatest economy ever put together. We were doing — this is a month and a half ago. We were doing numbers, the like — the likes of which we've never done. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American — best employment numbers ever in the history of our country. Our employment numbers, the best in the history of our country: almost 160 million people. The stock market: record numbers, many, many times during my tenure. Many, many times."
549,2020-04-05,"But now we have a country that we had to close because of this. And, frankly, if we didn't close it, we would have lost millions of people possibly, but certainly we would have lost a million people. You take the high number and cut it in half, cut it in half again. But whether it would have been 600, 700, 800, you take a look at the travesty that there is. You take a look at this horrible, horrible scene of hospitals with bodies in black body bags, right? Multiply that times 10, 15, or even 20, because that would have happened."
550,2020-04-05,"So we did the right thing. So far, we did the right thing. So far, we've called it right. We've mobilized like it was a military operation. And it was largely a militarily operation, between ventilators and testing and so many other things. And we've had a lot of good partners. Not all good partners, but we had a lot of good partners."
551,2020-04-05,"Gavin Newsom today thanked us very much. Gavin Newsom — California — thanked us so much for getting him all the things that he needed so he can keep going and keep doing a good job. We got it to him today. Tomorrow, we're getting him even more. It would've been harder for him to get it than us. We agreed to get it. We got it on time. He said, “Promises made, promises kept.” He actually said that in a statement today."
552,2020-04-05,"We've done a good job. We've gotten very little credit for the great job we've done because of the media. Because the media is not an honest media, in my opinion. Much of it, not all of it. We have some great reporters that I have tremendous respect, but much of the media is not honest."
553,2020-04-05,"So I can't tell you about the election. You have a Democrat Party and you have a large portion of the media automatically giving the guy a pass. He's been given a pass. Whether or not he's going to be the nominee, I have no idea, but he's getting a pass."
554,2020-04-05,"And the media isn't covering the great job that we've done, whether it's Mike's task force, which has been incredible; whether it's the way we mobilized in a war-like operation to build these incredibly complex and very expensive ventilators. They're very expensive to build and very complex. The job we've done has been an amazing job. And I'm not talking about me; I'm talking about everybody. I'm talking about the generals, the admirals, Deborah and Tony, and — and now Bill. I mean, something we hadn't heard today."
555,2020-04-05,"So I can't tell you what's going to happen with the election. I think that had we not gone through a fake Russia, Russia, Russia deal; an impeachment hoax — it was a total hoax. From the day I got elected — but, you know, it wasn't the day; it was many months before I got elected — this has been a witch hunt that was illegal. It was an illegal witch hunt. It was illegal."
556,2020-04-05,"And with all of that, I'm doing fine, because the people see we're doing a great job. And you know what? We'll continue to do a great job."
557,2020-04-05,"If we had an honest press, this country would be even greater."
558,2020-04-05,Thank you. Thank you very much.
559,2020-04-05,"Hello, everybody. Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you. Beautiful day. Very good what you're doing. Look at all those empty seats. Never seen it like that. Oh, boy. Well, how the world has changed. How the world has changed, right? But it's going to end up being better than ever."
560,2020-04-05,I want to thank you very much for being here. And I'd like to update you on the steps we're taking on our ongoing fight to defeat the virus.
561,2020-04-05,"This morning at 7:55, I spoke to the leaders of the G20. Had a great meeting. And we have a lot of different ideas, a lot of good ideas. We're working together. The leaders gathered virtually around the world to discuss the whole subject of the problem that, right now, 151 nations have got. We had:"
562,2020-04-05,"• President Alberto Fernández of Argentina • Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia • President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil • Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada • President Xi of China • President Emmanuel Macron of France • Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany • Prime Minister Modi of India • President Widodo of Indonesia • Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy • Prime Minister Shinzō Abe of Japan. Congratulations to Japan on making a great decision on the Olympics. Going to make it next year, 2021. • President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico. I want to thank the President of Mexico for having done such a great job with respect to the military. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border, and very few people are getting through — I can tell you that. And we got to keep it that way. And we have a great relationship with Mexico now. • President Putin of Russia • King Salman of Saudi Arabia • President Ramaphosa of South Africa • President Moon of, as you know, a country that we spend a lot of time in: South Korea. We're working very hard on that. • Prime Minister Sánchez of Spain • President Erdoğan of Turkey • Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom • President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen • President of the European Council Charles Michel • United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres • World Health Organization Director Tedros Adhanom • World Bank President David Malpass • and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva"
563,2020-04-05,"So, that's a big group but it's a great group. It's — and they were all there — every one of them. And we talked about the problem. And hopefully it won't be a problem for too much longer."
564,2020-04-05,"The United States is working with our friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate our efforts. We discussed how vitally important it is for all of our nations to immediately share information and data — and we've been doing that, to a large extent, but we'll do it even more so — and to inform our — I guess you could say inform each of us on the fight that we've got going one way or the other. It's a little bit different, but we're handling it a little bit in different ways."
565,2020-04-05,"But there is great uniformity, I think. We had a — it was a terrific meeting. Tremendous spirit among all of those countries. You had 20 countries plus the other people that I mentioned. And tremendous spirit to get this over with."
566,2020-04-05,"After the meeting with the world leaders, I spoke with the governors of our 50 states and territories. Our team has been in constant communication with the governors, and we had a terrific meeting."
567,2020-04-05,"Somebody in the fake news said that one of the governors said, “Oh, we need Tom Brady.” I said, “Yeah.” He meant that in a positive way. He said, “We need Tom Brady. We're going to do great.” And he meant it very positively, but they took it differently. “They think Tom Brady should be leading the effort.” That's only fake news. And I like Tom Brady. Spoke to him the other day. He's a great guy."
568,2020-04-05,"But I wish the news could be — could be real. I wish it could be honest. I wish it weren't corrupt, but so much of it is. It's so sad to see. Just so sad to see."
569,2020-04-05,"We had a great meeting. I tell you what: I'm sure you have tapes of the meeting. I'm sure that you were able to get tapes very easily. So you had 50 governors-plus. And if you had tapes, you'd see it was really — I mean, there was no contention. I would say virtually none. I would say maybe one person that was a little tiny bit of a raising of a voice, a little wise guy, a little bit. But he's usually a big wise guy. Not so much anymore. We saw to it that he wouldn't be so much anymore. But he is — we had a — I mean, I would rate — Mike was there; a lot of the folks in the back were there. And it was a — it was a great meeting. It took place at about 12 o'clock."
570,2020-04-05,So we went from the G20 to the governors. We also spoke about the economic relief with the governors and the package that we're moving through Congress to deliver much-needed financial assistance to hardworking families and small businesses.
571,2020-04-05,"I want to thank Democrats and Republicans in the Senate for unanimously passing the largest financial relief package in American history, 96 to 0. And I have to say it's the largest, by far, and I'm profoundly grateful that both parties came together to provide relief for American workers and families in this hour of need."
572,2020-04-05,"The House of Representatives must now pass this bill, hopefully without delay. I think it's got tremendous support. When you're at 96 to nothing — and, as you know, a couple of those people are quarantined, and one — Rand Paul — is — he's actually got it. But he'll — he'll be better. He's been a great guy. He's been a great friend of mine, actually."
573,2020-04-05,The massive $2.2 trillion relief package includes:
574,2020-04-05,• Job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that keep their workers on the payroll. That's pretty good. Loan forgiveness — keep the workers on the payroll. That's pretty good.
575,2020-04-05,"• Direct cash payments will be available to American citizens earning less than $99,000 per year; $3,400 for the typical family of four."
576,2020-04-05,• Expanded unemployment benefits. The average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months.
577,2020-04-05,"These are things that — by the way, we have plenty more to go and — but they're things that nobody has ever had any package like this done. And I just want to thank them. Hopefully, it'll get approved equally easily in the House, really. I think it will go through pretty well. From what I hear, virtually everybody."
578,2020-04-05,• Critical support for the hardest-hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks and tough new safeguards to prevent executive compensation abuse.
579,2020-04-05,"• Over $100 billion for our amazing doctors, nurses, and hospitals."
580,2020-04-05,"• $45 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund, more than doubling the amount available. This is tremendous stuff."
581,2020-04-05,"• $27 billion for the coronavirus response, including $16 billion to build up the Strategic National Stockpile with critical supplies including masks, respirators, and all sorts of pharmaceuticals."
582,2020-04-05,"• $3.5 billion to expand assistance to childcare providers and childcare benefits to healthcare workers, first responders, and others on the frontlines of the crisis. And these are really brave, incredible people, I have to say. And some of them are getting sick, and some of them are getting very sick, and some of them don't even recover. They're incredible people."
583,2020-04-05,"• $1 billion for Defense Production Act procurement. We are, as you know, using the Act, but we use it only when necessary. We use it as leverage. We generally don't have to use it to accomplish what we want to accomplish."
584,2020-04-05,"As of today, FEMA has shipped over 9 million N95 masks, 20 million face masks, 3.1 million face shields, nearly 6,000 ventilators, 2.6 million gowns, 14.6 million gloves. And we're sending more every day, and we've got tremendous amounts of equipment coming in."
585,2020-04-05,"A lot of great companies are making equipment right now. The ventilators, obviously they take a little longer to make, but we have a lot of companies making them. And we're going to be in great shape."
586,2020-04-05,"We took over an empty shelf. We took over a very depleted place, in a lot of ways. As you know, the testing is going very, very well. And that was obsolete and broken, and we fixed it and it's been going really good."
587,2020-04-05,"And I think, very importantly, the stockpile — we're really filling it up, and we fill it up rapidly, but we get it out. Sometimes we have it sent directly to the states instead."
588,2020-04-05,"And again, the state has to be doing this kind of a thing also. We're sort of a — we look — we look from behind a little bit and we look at how are they doing, and if they need help, we do it. But it's their first responsibility. Sometimes they just can't get it, but we load it up and we send it out. But if we can, we have it sent directly to the state. We want it to go directly to the point where we want it."
589,2020-04-05,"I can now announce something that I think is incredible, what they've done in the Navy, because the incredible naval hospital ship the USNS Comfort — which is incredible, actually, when you see it inside — will be underway to New York City on Saturday."
590,2020-04-05,"So it's going to be leaving on Saturday, rather than three weeks from now. They did the maintenance quickly, and it was going to be there for quite a while longer — another three or four weeks. And it should be arriving — I told the governor 20 minutes ago, Governor Cuomo, that the ship will be arriving in New York Harbor on Monday."
591,2020-04-05,"I think I'm going to go out and I'll kiss it goodbye. I'll go — I'll go to — it's in Virginia, as you know. And I will go and we'll be waving together because I suspect the media will be following. John, are you going to be following? Maybe. You never know."
592,2020-04-05,"It's a great ship. It's a great vessel, is right. So, if you want to go, I'll see you there. And if you don't, that's okay."
593,2020-04-05,"After being fully loaded with medical supplies, it's going to be — it's loaded up to the top. And it's over at the Norfolk Naval Base; that's where it departs. It is expected then to — I mean, we're saving about three to four weeks by the incredible work done by the Navy. And I actually look forward to Saturday to see it go."
594,2020-04-05,"The ship will arrive, and I believe it's going to get a little bit of a ceremony. There's something very beautiful about it. It's an incredible piece of work. Going to be landing at Pier 90 in Manhattan to provide hospital surge capacity for the New York metropolitan area. So it's a surge capacity. They may use it for this or they may have other people coming in from hospitals, unrelated to the virus, and then they'll use those hospitals on land. They'll use those hospitals for the virus."
595,2020-04-05,"But we'll see how they do it. They could do it either way — one way or the other, whichever one is best. But it could be — because it's set up so well for a regular hospital, that they may take people out of hospitals and then use those rooms for the virus."
596,2020-04-05,"The National Institute of Health and the private sector, working closely with the FDA, continue to collaborate to discover and test treatments and therapies that can effectively reduce the duration and symptoms of the virus and help — very much help people to recover. And I'm firmly committed to bringing these treatments to market very quickly."
597,2020-04-05,"We have a — we have a lot of tests going on with regard to different medicines. And I hope — I hope we get lucky. I hope we hit. A lot of talented scientists and doctors are working on therapeutics, a cure, vaccines. I think we're doing very well. Tony may speak to that a little bit later, but I think we're doing very well with regard to the vaccines."
598,2020-04-05,"I think we're doing well with regard to a lot of the things I just mentioned, but we'll have to see what happens. We're going to know fairly soon about a lot of them. But it's very advanced, and the vaccines are very advanced, prior to, as you know, a fairly reasonably long test period of, in that case, over a year."
599,2020-04-05,"Every American should be proud of the incredible spirit our country has brought to this effort. It's been incredible. Citizens from all walks of life have come together to turn the tide in this battle. We're witnessing the extraordinary power of American unity like a lot of people have never seen. Even getting a vote — you're talking about trillions of dollars, and you get a vote of 96 to nothing."
600,2020-04-05,"We are waging war on this virus using every financial, scientific, medical, pharmaceutical, and military resource to halt its spread and protect our citizens. I want to express our tremendous thanks to the American people for continuing to practice social distancing — like you people are practicing right here; I don't know, this room may never be the same — maintaining good hygiene, and follow government guidelines."
601,2020-04-05,"Vice President Pence lifts up that card every time. And it's not very complicated, but hopefully you can do that. And your commitment will make all the difference in the world. And that's — one of the big ones will be: For a while, stay home. Just relax. Stay home. We're making a lot of progress."
602,2020-04-05,"As we continue to gather more information and accelerate the testing — where we're doing record numbers of tests now, far more than any other country has done. I told you yesterday: Eight days here — because you heard so much about South Korea. The media kept talking, “South Korea, South Korea.” We have a great relationship with President Moon in South Korea. But when I hear so much about South Korea —"
603,2020-04-05,"So, in eight days — in eight days, we do more testing than they did in eight weeks. And it's a very highly sophisticated test, too."
604,2020-04-05,"We'll be able to deploy even more data-driven and targeted approaches to slow the — ultimately, you know, it's a very devastating thing, but we will vanquish this virus. And it's — a lot of progress has been made."
605,2020-04-05,"That's why earlier today I sent a letter to America's governors, describing how we will be using the data to update existing guidance on social distancing, which will be developed in close coordination with our nation's public health officials and scientists."
606,2020-04-05,"Because of the sacrifices of our great doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals, the brilliance of our scientists and researchers, and the goodness and generosity of our people, I know that we will achieve victory and quickly return to the path of exceptional health, safety, and prosperity for all of our citizens."
607,2020-04-05,"We have to get back to work. Our people want to work. They want to go back. They have to go back. And we're going to be talking about dates. We're going to be talking with a lot of great professionals. But this is a country that was built on getting it done, and our people want to go back to work. I'm hearing — I'm hearing it loud and clear from everybody. So we'll see what — what happens. We're going to have a lot more information early next week, and we'll be reporting that back."
608,2020-04-05,"But I just want to leave it with you: We have to go back. This is the United States of America. They don't want to sit around and wait. And they'll be practicing — and, by the way, a lot of people misinterpret when I say “go back.” They're going to be practicing, as much as you can, social distancing and washing your hands and not shaking hands and all of the things that we talk about so much. But they have to go back to work. Our country has to go back. Our country is based on that."
609,2020-04-05,"And I think it's going to happen pretty quickly. I think it's going to happen pretty quickly. A lot of progress is made, but we got to go back to work. We may take sections of our country. We may take large sections of our country that aren't so seriously affected, and we may do it that way. But we've got to start the process pretty soon. So we'll be talking to you a little bit more about that next week."
610,2020-04-05,"And with that, if you have any questions, you could ask. And then I'm going to have the Vice President stay behind, and he's going to take questions and also introduce some of the people. You can ask them some questions."
611,2020-04-05,"John, please."
612,2020-04-05,Yeah.
613,2020-04-05,No. Not at all.
614,2020-04-05,"Oh, sure."
615,2020-04-05,"Well, it's nobody's fault — certainly not in this country. Nobody's fault. We got very lucky when we made a decision not to allow people in from China at a very early date. I say that because some people don't want to accept it. But this was a great decision made by our country, or there's — the numbers that you're talking about — we're a big country; they'd be far greater, far bigger."
616,2020-04-05,"So when I heard the number — I mean, I heard it could be 6 million, could be 7 million. It's 3.3 or 3.2. But it's a lot of jobs. But I think we'll come back very strong. The sooner we get back to work — you know, every day that we stay out, it gets harder to bring it back very quickly. And our people don't want to stay out."
617,2020-04-05,"So I know those numbers, John, but I think you'll see a very fast turnaround once we have a victory over the “hidden enemy,” as I say. It's a hidden enemy. Sometimes a hidden enemy is a lot tougher than somebody that stares you in the face, right? So we'll see what happens. But, I mean, they're fully expected numbers — at least. I mean, at least."
618,2020-04-05,"Steve, please."
619,2020-04-05,Yeah.
620,2020-04-05,"Well, we have very strong deployments on the southern border, as you know, with Mexico. And we had some troops up in Canada. But I'll find out about that. I guess it's equal justice, to a certain extent. But, in Canada, we have — we do have troops along the border."
621,2020-04-05,"You know, we have a lot of things coming in from Canada. We have trade — some illegal trade that we don't like. We have very strong sanctions on some. We have very strong tariffs on dumping steel. And we don't like steel coming through our border that's been dumped in Canada so they can avoid the tariff."
622,2020-04-05,"You know, I charge a lot of tariff for the steel. And it's been great for our steel companies because now they can really go — you look at what's happened with steel. It's been pretty incredible. But we've taken in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs on steel, and much of it comes in from China, but they can come through the Canadian border, too. So we're always watching for that."
623,2020-04-05,"No, I think it's a tribute to our testing. You know, number one, you don't know what the numbers are in China. China tells you numbers, and — I'm speaking to President Xi tonight, I believe, and we'll have a good conversation, I'm sure. But you just don't know, you know, what are the numbers. But I think it's a tribute to the testing. We're testing tremendous numbers of people and every day — the way the system works."
624,2020-04-05,"And I want to thank, especially, Roche has been fantastic. Great company. They've done a tremendous amount. Deborah was telling me before that they were really — they've really stepped up to the plate and done great, as have other of the companies, but it seems that they're really doing it particularly well. So, you know, we'll see what happens there."
625,2020-04-05,But it's a tribute to the amount of testing that we're doing. We're doing tremendous testing. And I'm sure you're not able to tell what China is testing or not testing; I think that's a little hard.
626,2020-04-05,"No, I didn't say that. No, you're wrong. I didn't say that."
627,2020-04-05,"I said some people were projecting that it would be 6 or 7, and it's, I believe, 3.3."
628,2020-04-05,Yeah.
629,2020-04-05,"So — well, I mean, the things I just read to you are being considered and other things are being considered. People are going to be getting big checks. And it's not their fault. What happened to them is not their fault."
630,2020-04-05,"So we're doing — we're doing a lot of different things on health insurance. We have meetings on it today. We're taking care of our people. This is not their fault what happened, and we're taking care. We're starting off by sending them very big checks. I think, for a family of four, it's about $3,000. And we're taking care of our people. We're taking care of our workers."
631,2020-04-05,"This was not — you know, as I say, this was not a financial crisis; this was a health crisis, a medical crisis. We're going to take care of our people."
632,2020-04-05,Please. Yeah. Please.
633,2020-04-05,Restaurant.
634,2020-04-05,"Well, I hate to — I know the business very well, I understand the restaurant business. It's a very delicate business. It's a business that — that — it's not easy. You know, I always say, in a restaurant business, you can serve 30 great meals to a person or a family, and they love it; one bad meal — number 31 — they never come back again. It's a very tough business."
635,2020-04-05,"But there are great people that run restaurants. And I've heard 3 percent could be lost and you could go as high as 10 or 11 percent, but they'll all come back in one form or another. It might be a different restaurant, but it's going to be a great business for a lot of people. And we're making it easy for people to — look, what we're doing — what we're doing in terms of loans, what we're doing in terms of salaries — they'll all come back. It may not be the same restaurant, it may not be the same ownership, but they'll all be back."
636,2020-04-05,"Yes, sir. Please."
637,2020-04-05,"Well, I talked about the Defense Production Act a lot. And I've — you know, I've enacted it. I have it. I can do it with a pen. And we have actually used it on two minor occasions and then we could withdraw it."
638,2020-04-05,"But, for the most part, the companies — we don't need it. We say, “We need this,” and they say, “Don't bother. We're going to do it.” I mean, we — we're dealing with Ford, General Motors, 3M. We're dealing with great companies. They want to do this. They want to do this. They're doing things that — that frankly, they don't need somebody to walk over there with a — with a hammer and say, “Do it.” They are getting it done. They're making tremendous amounts of equipment. Tremendous amounts."
639,2020-04-05,"And when this is over, we're going to be fully stockpiled, which they would have never been, except for a circumstance — this was — this was something that nobody has ever thought could happen to this country. I'm not even blaming — look, we inherited a broken situation, but I don't totally blame the people that were before me and this administration. Nobody would have ever thought a thing like this could have happened."
640,2020-04-05,"But the Production Act — Defense Production Act — is a wonderful thing, but I just haven't had to use it. They know it's activated. They know I can use it. Maybe that frightens them a little bit. You know, it's got tremendous power. But I haven't had to."
641,2020-04-05,Please.
642,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. Where are they? They're all outside, trying to get in. I know."
643,2020-04-05,"So, I'm a big fan of Senator Hawley. And I also like the idea. There were some senators that didn't want to do anything like Carnival — great company — but they're based in different places. I won't tell you where. I could tell you exactly where they're based, but I won't do that. But they're based in actually more than one place, as you know. Ships are registered in different locations."
644,2020-04-05,"I do like the concept of perhaps coming in and registering here, coming into the United States. It's — you know, it's very tough to make a loan to a company when they're based in a different country. But, with that being said, they have thousands and thousands of people that work there and, maybe almost as importantly, that work onshore, filling the ships with goods and products. And the cruise line business is very important."
645,2020-04-05,"And I know Carnival, what a great job they do. Micky Arison. And I would think that we could stick with Senator Hawley and maybe really look at that very seriously."
646,2020-04-05,"Look, it's a big business. It's a great business. It's a — it's a business that employs tremendous of number of people, outside of the ship itself. I mean, you look — you look at these ports. It's loaded up with shops and — and people that are involved with the ship. So we're going to work very hard on the cruise line business and we're going to try and work something out, but I like the concept."
647,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead."
648,2020-04-05,Yeah. Sure.
649,2020-04-05,"So, the airline business a very tough business. Over many years, it's been very, very tough. It's got everything. It's got labor. It's got very strong, powerful — you know, you look at the cost of these airliners. Everything is tough — very highly technological. You look at how complicated, how complex. It's got unions. It's got everything. The airline business, generally speaking, has unions. It's a very tough business; always been a very tough business."
650,2020-04-05,"With that being said, we have to keep our airlines going. And we're going to be using some — now, maybe we'll take a piece of the airlines for the country, for our country; where we loan money and we take a piece. It's all fully ready. We're ready to go. But if we didn't do that, we'd end up with no airlines and we can't do that."
651,2020-04-05,"The airline business is very vital to our country. It's a tough business. We have to understand that. So, not — I mean, I could tell you other businesses that are different kinds of business. They're very good businesses, but airlines have always been very, very tough."
652,2020-04-05,Please.
653,2020-04-05,No. Please.
654,2020-04-05,"Yeah. I didn't call you, I called this gentleman."
655,2020-04-05,Who are you with?
656,2020-04-05,Who are you with?
657,2020-04-05,Yeah. Bloomberg News.
658,2020-04-05,How's Michael doing? Good?
659,2020-04-05,"No, I didn't. I'm speaking to him tonight. It's scheduled to go tonight. I'll have a call with President Xi of China. I have a very good relationship."
660,2020-04-05,"No, I didn't like when they came up. And it — it wasn't him. Somebody at a lower level — mid-level — we found out, pretty much. But they made a statement that our soldiers brought it into China. No, it came from China."
661,2020-04-05,"And, you know, we just signed a very big deal with China. They're paying us a lot of money in tariffs and other things. They never paid us 10 cents."
662,2020-04-05,"Look, China has taken advantage of the United States — until I came here — with Sleepy Joe Biden and Obama and Bush and everybody else. I'm not blaming them; I'm blaming everybody. They were allowed to — $500 billion a year they were taking out. We had trade deficits that were so large nobody's ever seen anything like it."
663,2020-04-05,"And we've changed it. Look, now we're taking in billions of dollars. And we gave some to our farmers because China, you know, they targeted our farmers. And our farmers are very happy and our farmers got through a very rough period because of what I was able to do — took the money from China and gave it to the farmers — and we had plenty left over after that."
664,2020-04-05,Now we're going into a phase two negotiation with China. But we're getting 25 percent on $250 billion and then we're getting a lot on money after that.
665,2020-04-05,So we've never had a deal with China. They — China took advantage of the United States. And you know what? I don't blame China for that. I blame the people that were right here because they should have never allowed it to happen. But the relationship with China has been a very good one.
666,2020-04-05,"He never asked me to calm it down, no. Somebody might have spoken to somebody, but nobody spoke to me about it."
667,2020-04-05,"I think it was time though, because, you know, I talk about the Chinese virus and — and I mean it. That's where it came from. You know, if you look at Ebola, if you look at all — Lyme. Right? Lyme, Connecticut. You look at all these different, horrible diseases, they seem to come with a name with the location. And this was a Chinese virus. But I don't have to say it, if they feel so strongly about it. We'll see."
668,2020-04-05,"But, you know, we have — we just made a great deal with China — great, hopefully, for both parties. But we've made a deal with China and we're going to do another one, it looks like. They want to do it very badly. Maybe they want to wait, like Iran. They want to wait to see whether or not Trump gets beaten in the election because would they love to negotiate with Biden or somebody else other than me. They would love it. That's their best dream in the world. So many others."
669,2020-04-05,"So, there are some that maybe are, you know, waiting until after November 3rd, the Election Day. But I think we're doing very well."
670,2020-04-05,"It would be sad if we blew all of the advantages that we have right now because we've made unbelievable trade deal. Whether it's Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, and others, we have — we have changed the whole thing around."
671,2020-04-05,Please.
672,2020-04-05,Yeah.
673,2020-04-05,"I think Deborah will talk to you about that, and Tony, in a few minutes. But I think we'll start talking about that. Because we have to open up. We can't say, “Let's close.” The people don't want to close, John. I say it again and again. The reason I do: because I want you to report it eventually."
674,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Steve."
675,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Steve."
676,2020-04-05,"Yeah. It's his call. I mean, I'll talk to him whenever he wants to."
677,2020-04-05,"I mean, you know, we'll have, I think, a very fruitful call. We'll have a good call tonight at 9 o'clock."
678,2020-04-05,Please.
679,2020-04-05,"Yes, in the back."
680,2020-04-05,"We'll be talking about that, yeah. We'll be talking about the virus."
681,2020-04-05,"Yeah. In the back first, please."
682,2020-04-05,Yeah. Record.
683,2020-04-05,"No, not yet. It hasn't passed, but it's come a long way. I think they think we're doing a really good job, in terms of running this whole situation, having to do with the virus. I think they feel that — I think they feel the administration — myself and the administration — are doing a good job with people — keeping, very importantly, people informed. Because there was a great fear."
684,2020-04-05,"And a lot of good things are happening. The mortality rate is at a, in my opinion — you'll have to speak to Deborah, Tony, all of the others — but in my opinion, it's way, way down. And that takes a lot of fear out. You know, it's one thing to have it; it's another thing to die."
685,2020-04-05,"You know, when I first got involved, I was being told numbers that were much, much higher than the number that seems to be. And remember that people that have it — many people have it. I just spoke to two people. They had it. They never went to a doctor. They had it — absolutely had it — but they never went to a doctor. They never went to anything. They didn't even report it. You have thousands and — hundreds of thousands of cases like that. So you have to add that to the caseload also."
686,2020-04-05,"And the people that actually die, that percentage is — is a much lower percentage than I ever thought. That's one of the reasons I say, “Look, we're going to beat this and we're going to get back to work.”"
687,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
688,2020-04-05,Sounds appropriate.
689,2020-04-05,"Well, no, no, I — we don't look at a weak point. This is a serious problem for over 150 nations — the virus. I would say this: Maduro and Venezuela, we're watching it very closely. We'll see what happens. But that is correct: Those charges were made."
690,2020-04-05,Please.
691,2020-04-05,Yeah.
692,2020-04-05,We will give you that notification. We'll let you know. Okay?
693,2020-04-05,Yeah.
694,2020-04-05,"I want those guidelines to go, even when we're open and fully operational. And, frankly, much of the guidelines, like shaking hands — maybe people aren't going to be shaking hands anymore."
695,2020-04-05,"You know, Tony had mentioned to me — Tony Fauci — the other day that — I don't think he was — would be too upset with the concept of not shaking hands. He was saying that the flu would cut down — the regular flu would be cut down by quite a bit if we didn't do that, if we didn't shake hands. You know, the regular flu, of which — you know, you have a lot of deaths and a lot of problems with that too. So I think a lot of — a lot of great things are going to —"
696,2020-04-05,"When we're open — just so — just to finish. When we're open, as soon as we open, that doesn't mean you're going to stop with the guidelines. You'll still try and distance yourself. Maybe not to the same extent because you have to lead a life, but I think the time is coming."
697,2020-04-05,"How about one more question? Go ahead, in the back, please."
698,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
699,2020-04-05,"Yes, I do. Very important to me."
700,2020-04-05,It's very important to me. They have to — we have to protect our Asian Americans. It's very — it's a very important — that was a very important tweet to me because I didn't like things that I was hearing.
701,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
702,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know. All I know is this: Asian Americans in our country are doing fantastically well. I'm very close to them, as you know, and they're doing fantastically well. And I think they appreciate the job we're doing."
703,2020-04-05,"But I did want to put that statement out — the social media statement — because, to me, Asian Americans are a great part of our country."
704,2020-04-05,Thank you all very much. We'll see you soon. Thank you.
705,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus.
706,2020-04-05,"We'll be invoking the Defense Production Act, just in case we need it. In other words, I think you all know what it is, and it can do a lot of good things if we need it. And we will — we will have it all completed, signing it in just a little while. Right after I'm finished with this conference, I'll be signing it. It's prepared to go. So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act."
707,2020-04-05,"Last week, I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which, as you know, we invoked previously and which activated FEMA's National Response Coordination Center. FEMA now is fully engaged at the highest levels."
708,2020-04-05,"Today, FEMA is activated in every region. We are at level one — level one being the highest level — which we will work with, and we've been working with FEMA. I've done a lot of work with FEMA. They're incredible. It's always been on hurricanes or tornadoes."
709,2020-04-05,"They're, right now, in Tennessee — a large group working in Tennessee. Have been incredible. That was a tragic event. Alabama, last year, also a tornado. And then, obviously the numerous hurricanes in different locations that were, in some cases, very devastating. And, in every case, FEMA came through."
710,2020-04-05,"This is a very different kind of work for FEMA, but they will come through as they always do. We have tremendous people, tremendous talent in FEMA."
711,2020-04-05,"We're sending, upon request, the two hospital ships; they're being prepared right now. They're massive ships. They're the big white ships with the red cross on the sides. One is called the Mercy and the other is called the Comfort. And they are in tip-top shape. They soon will be. They're getting ready to come up to New York. I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it. He's excited about it."
712,2020-04-05,"And I also — we haven't made the final determination as to where it's going to go on the West Coast. The Comfort is located now in San Diego, and it's going to be — we'll be picking the destination fairly shortly. So those two ships are being prepared to go, and they can be launched over the next week or so, depending on need."
713,2020-04-05,"Earlier this week, the first clinical trial of the vaccine candidate for the virus began in Washington State, as you probably know. The genetic sequence of the virus was first published in January. But thanks to the unprecedented partnership between the FDA, NIH, and the private sector, we've reached human trials for the vaccine just eight weeks later. That's a record by many, many months. It used to take years to do this, and now we did it just in a very short while."
714,2020-04-05,"That's the fastest development in history of what we're doing with regard to the vaccine. We're making very, very big progress."
715,2020-04-05,"Today I can announce further steps to expand testing capacity. We're working with several groups to determine if the self-swab — a much easier process than the current process that's not very nice to do, I can tell you, because I did it. But we have a current process that's a little bit difficult."
716,2020-04-05,"If you haven't done — the groups are working on determining if a self-swab by an individual is as effective as the other. The other is very effective, very accurate. But we're going to see if we can do a self-swab, which is — would be a lot more popular, I can tell you that. So — and that would be administered also by a health official, but it would be a lot easier to do."
717,2020-04-05,"The — the fact is that the health professionals would — it would free — it would free up a lot. Let me just say, the self-swab is what it is: It's a self-swab; you do it yourself. The other has to be issued by a health professional, and it's something that is quite difficult. And we think it's working out for the self-swab. And if it would test positive, the people would go and they would do what they have to do. But we think that's probably working out."
718,2020-04-05,I've asked the FDA to cut through the red tape and reduce regulatory barriers. We are looking at some very exciting things. And I'm going to be holding a second news conference either today. We're going to talk about the FDA. Some things are happening that are quite exciting. And we're going to be doing that either later today or tomorrow — fairly early tomorrow. So we'll see what happens.
719,2020-04-05,"But the FDA, at my instruction, is — have been working very, very hard on a number of developments, and we'll be discussing them with you later today or tomorrow."
720,2020-04-05,"And this afternoon, I'll be meeting with nurses on the frontlines of the battle against the virus. They are truly American heroes. They want to get it done. They're incredible people. So we're going to be meeting with nurses, and I actually look forward to that. They're very brave. They're taking a lot of risk. And they — they have done an incredible job and they never complain."
721,2020-04-05,"Today, I'm also announcing that the Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. So we're working very closely with Dr. Ben Carson and everybody from HUD."
722,2020-04-05,"Every generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation. In World War Two, young people in their teenage years volunteered to fight. They wanted to fight so badly because they love our country. Workers refused to go home and slept on factory floors to keep assembly lines running."
723,2020-04-05,"And, you know, the numbers of ships that they built during World War Two, to this day has never — nothing like that has ever been equal. They were doing ships on a — literally on a daily basis. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. To this day, nobody has seen anything like what they were able to do during World War Two."
724,2020-04-05,And now it's our time. We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we'll come through together. It's the invisible enemy. That's always the toughest enemy: the invisible enemy. But we're going to defeat the invisible enemy. I think we're going to do it even faster than we thought. And it will be a complete victory. It'll be a total victory.
725,2020-04-05,"So we'll have a second conference, again, having to do with the FDA and this. I think it's going to be potentially a very exciting news conference. And we will do it as quickly as we can, so whether it's today or tomorrow."
726,2020-04-05,"And I'll, with that, ask Mike Pence to say a few words. And thank you very much."
727,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Dr. Birx, please."
728,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Deborah, very much."
729,2020-04-05,"Mark, please."
730,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, Mark."
731,2020-04-05,"Seema, go ahead."
732,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
733,2020-04-05,"Robert, please."
734,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Robert, thank you. Thank you all. That's very nice."
735,2020-04-05,Any questions? Please.
736,2020-04-05,"No, well, I don't agree with that. Yeah — no, I don't agree. That's a absolute total worst-case scenario. But, no, we don't look at that at all."
737,2020-04-05,We're nowhere near it.
738,2020-04-05,Because it comes from China.
739,2020-04-05,It's not racist at all. No. Not at all. It comes from China. That's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.
740,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please, John."
741,2020-04-05,No.
742,2020-04-05,"No, I have a great — I have great love for all of the people from our country. But, as you know, China tried to say at one point — maybe they stopped now — that it was caused by American soldiers. That can't happen. It's not going to happen — not as long as I'm President. It comes from China."
743,2020-04-05,"John, please."
744,2020-04-05,Yes.
745,2020-04-05,Yeah.
746,2020-04-05,"We do have. We have tremendous numbers of ventilators, but there's never been an instance like this where no matter what you have, it's not enough. That would be the case. And we will be — it's being signed. It's essentially drawn, and I'm going to sign it in just a little while. If we need to use it, we'll be using it at full speed ahead."
747,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to know whether or not urgent. But we will — yeah, we do have targets. We have targets for certain pieces of equipment. We have targets for masks. You know, the masks — the numbers of masks are incredible. We've ordered millions of them. But we need millions more."
748,2020-04-05,"This — a thing like this has never been requested, and it's never — we've never had even to think in terms of these numbers, but we need millions of masks. And all of that will be ordered. We need respirators. We need — ventilators is a big thing because it's a complex piece of equipment. So we have a lot of ventilators, but we're going to be ordering more."
749,2020-04-05,"To be determined. We're working with the Senate right now. We're working with everybody on Capitol Hill. There's been tremendous — there really has been. I mean, with some exceptions, obviously, because it's always the way it is. But there has been — they've been getting along very well, Republicans and Democrats. It's a nice thing. Very bipartisan so far."
750,2020-04-05,"I do. I actually do. I'm looking at it that way because, you know, if — if it got out of control — the big thing we did was a very early stoppage of people coming in who could be very, very heavily infected. And that was a –that was a very good move."
751,2020-04-05,"And it was very early — very, very early — when most people, including a lot of professionals, they didn't want us to do it. That really saved a lot of lives."
752,2020-04-05,"And, yeah, I look at it — I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that's what we're fighting. I mean, it's — it's a very tough situation. You're — you have to do things. You have to — you have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they've ever been. We had the best economy we've ever had. And then, one day, you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy. And — but we're doing it, and we're doing it well."
753,2020-04-05,"And I'll tell you, the American people have been incredible. For the most part, they've been really incredible. Yeah, please, Kaitlan."
754,2020-04-05,"Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators, too. And when we have thousands of ventilators — it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing. Normally, we wouldn't be doing testing. And they decided to do it. Very, very hard to ramp up. Now we're getting highly sophisticated tests, and it's going very well. But nobody has ever heard of testing in the kind of quantities that you're talking about."
755,2020-04-05,"Well, we knew — it depends. It depends on how it goes. Worst case, absolutely. Best case, not at all. So we're going to have to see where it goes. But we are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators. And they're complex. You know, these are complex machines, and — but we're ordering them."
756,2020-04-05,"Does anybody have a — Mike, maybe you do. How many do we have and we're ordering?"
757,2020-04-05,We can give you that exact number. We'll give it to you.
758,2020-04-05,"Yeah. One second. One second, Kaitlan. We'll do it in a second. You'll be able to."
759,2020-04-05,Yes.
760,2020-04-05,"No, I said, “Not yet.” I spoke with the Prime Minister, Trudeau. Very good relationship, obviously, between us and our two countries."
761,2020-04-05,And no tipping point. It's just that we want to — we want to isolate from the standpoint we don't want people coming into contact. Because that's the way we're going to win this war. That is so important. And we both thought it was time.
762,2020-04-05,"Now, it's not affecting trade. It's non-essential. It's non-essential crossings. It won't affect trade at all, and it was just something we thought would be good for both countries. Yes, please."
763,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
764,2020-04-05,"Well, they're doing it in a very careful manner. You can only be vigilant and very professional. But we're not — it's not pertaining at this moment to trade between the two countries."
765,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
766,2020-04-05,"It could be. It could be. And we're also playing with a lot of numbers — a lot of very big numbers and a lot of very small numbers, frankly. We want to take care of — we have to help everybody. It was nobody's fault. This happened. I mean, some people could say it was somebody's fault, actually. But it was nobody's fault, and certainly none of these companies that, all of a sudden, had no passengers and planes and had no passengers on cruise ships and all of the things that have happened."
767,2020-04-05,"But I will say that they can't be blamed for this. And we want to keep those companies vibrant because it's — there's going to be a comeback very, very quickly, as soon as this is solved. And it will be solved. We will win. And there will be a comeback, and it'll take place very quickly."
768,2020-04-05,"Well, no, I don't want to say that because it's a moving — these are all — every number that you mentioned, yes, we've talked about those numbers; we're also moving those numbers in both directions. So we'll let you know. It'll be — it's moving along fast."
769,2020-04-05,"Again, there's a great bipartisan effort going on that I haven't really seen before to this extent."
770,2020-04-05,"No, they're looking at it. They're looking — it's down the line and they're looking at it very seriously. And I think it would be a great thing because the other is, to use a nice word, it's very inconvenient, and it's very tough."
771,2020-04-05,"Well, I think we're doing a really good job. We started off with a termination of the border — the people coming in from China, where this all started. That meant I took it very seriously. And when I use the word “calm” — “calm” doesn't mean that I'm not taking it seriously. “Calm” means — and we should be calm. We should be extremely calm."
772,2020-04-05,"But, yeah, 95 percent within the Republican Party, and over 50 percent. And I also have — we have very great approval numbers. I mean, people like the job that we're doing. And when you compare this to other epidemics, or if you want to use a different term, you can, but within this country — and you look at what's happened over the years, this is being handled very, very professionally. We have the greatest professionals in the world. We're doing a good job. Nobody has ever been swamped like this in — nothing has been so contagious — the level of contagion has been incredible, actually. Nobody has seen anything quite like this."
773,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Peter, go ahead."
774,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Well, I'll let — I'll let Mike answer that."
775,2020-04-05,Deborah?
776,2020-04-05,"Well, that — you'd have to ask them that question. I mean, they — I — I've read —"
777,2020-04-05,"No, I wouldn't say so, but perhaps that's been the story of life. That does happen on occasion. And I've noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly."
778,2020-04-05,"Look, we inherited a very —"
779,2020-04-05,"Excuse me. Excuse me. We inherited a very obsolete system. This was a system that was out of date, obsolete, or it was a system that was never meant to take care of the kind of quantity, the number of people that we're talking about — millions and millions of people."
780,2020-04-05,"If you go back in years past, like even recently with the flu, nobody had tests before. They didn't test the entire nation to see whether or not they had flu. They got the flu, they got better — hopefully, they got better — and that was it. Now, all of a sudden, they do this very complex testing."
781,2020-04-05,"What we've done is we've broken it down, we've broken up the system, but it was obsolete and/or you could say it was also a system that just wasn't meant to handle the kind of volume that you're talking about. We've rebuilt it into a system that, for the future, will be a very good system if you want to go this route."
782,2020-04-05,"But this was never done before. And I would imagine it will be done in the future, but we've built it into a very good system by using private companies — the great private companies. And I have to say Roche has been doing a very good job. They're doing a lot of work, a very good job."
783,2020-04-05,But this was an obsolete system. This was not a system that was meant to do anything like this or even near this.
784,2020-04-05,John?
785,2020-04-05,"Who heads that group? Those countries do, probably. Go check."
786,2020-04-05,"No, I know. I'm sure free trade."
787,2020-04-05,"Look, China is paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there's no reason to do that. They haven't even spoken to me about that. China hasn't asked me to do that, but we're getting billions of dollars a year from tariffs from China. And I can't imagine Americans asking for that, but it could be that China will ask for a suspension or something. We'll see what happens."
788,2020-04-05,"China is having a very rough time. They have their worst year in 76 years, as I understand it. They're having a very, very tough time. And then, on top of it, this happened with the virus."
789,2020-04-05,"But, no, we're taking in billions of dollars a year in tariffs. And this was caused by something totally unrelated to tariffs."
790,2020-04-05,The answer is yes.
791,2020-04-05,Very soon. Probably today.
792,2020-04-05,Yes?
793,2020-04-05,Yeah.
794,2020-04-05,"Well, I think “essential” is medical. We have military working together; we have industry working together. And, again, it's not affecting trade. So things like that."
795,2020-04-05,"But just leisurely, “Let's go to a restaurant and have dinner” — which a lot of people do. They come both ways; they go in both directions. That kind of thing, we have ended on a temporary basis."
796,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please go ahead."
797,2020-04-05,"Not close it. No, we're not going to close it. But we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do."
798,2020-04-05,Please.
799,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead. You know what — go ahead. Sure."
800,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
801,2020-04-05,I haven't seen the article.
802,2020-04-05,"No, I haven't seen the article. We will — we are making a lot of progress therapeutically, I will say that. And — but I have not seen that article, no."
803,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
804,2020-04-05,"Well, there were certain industries that people know. I mean, the airlines would be number one. If you look at what's going on, they go from having the best year they've ever had to having no passengers because of what we've had to do in order to win this war. It's a war. And so, you know, basically, you know what many of the industries are."
805,2020-04-05,"What we want to do is we want to make sure that they all stay together so that after the war is won, we can immediately go right back up to where we were, and even beyond. I think we're going to go beyond where we were. And a lot of people are saying that, by the way. We're poised to do that, but we have to win the war first."
806,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Please, go ahead."
807,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Sure. We're talking about all of it. I haven't detailed it yet. We have detailed it to senators and to members of the House. We have been talking about it, and we're coming up with numbers. Haven't gotten there yet, but, certainly, hotel industry, the cruise ship industry, the airlines. Those are all prime candidates, absolutely."
808,2020-04-05,Which border?
809,2020-04-05,Yeah.
810,2020-04-05,"I would say 30 days, and hopefully, at the end of 30 days, we'll be in great shape."
811,2020-04-05,"Jeff, please."
812,2020-04-05,"Well, I think my earlier comments are to be calm. I mean, I do want people to be calm, because we're going to win this and we're going to win it. It's just a question of time. And I want it to go quickly. So based on the fact that I want it to go quickly, I hope they just listen to what we've been saying over the last period of time."
813,2020-04-05,"We don't want them gathering. And I see they do gather, including on beaches and including in restaurants — young people. They don't realize that — they're feeling invincible. I don't know if you felt invincible when you were very young, but they were feeling totally invincible or — are feeling that way, but they don't realize that they can be carrying lots of bad things home to grandmother and grandfather and even their parents."
814,2020-04-05,"So we want them to heed the advice. We mean the advice. And I think it's getting through. I do believe it's getting through, Jeff."
815,2020-04-05,If they're what?
816,2020-04-05,"Well, I think I just said it."
817,2020-04-05,"Heed the advice. Heed the advice. I just said. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Peter."
818,2020-04-05,"We'll get to you next, okay?"
819,2020-04-05,Say it?
820,2020-04-05,"Not “think.” No, no. I don't “think.” I know who — where it came from."
821,2020-04-05,"I don't know if you'd say China is to blame. Certainly, we didn't get an early run on it. It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier. But it comes from China, and there's not a question about that. Nobody is questioning that."
822,2020-04-05,"Well, I have a lot of respect for Tom Cotton, and I know exactly what he's been saying. And there are those people that say that. So we'll see what happens. Thank you."
823,2020-04-05,Go ahead. It's your turn. Go ahead.
824,2020-04-05,Please. He's been waiting a long time. Please. You've had your hand up so nicely for a long time. It's your time.
825,2020-04-05,"Right. Yeah, I'm not happy to see it. I don't — you know, I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups. I think you know that very well. But I don't like seeing that at all. I'm not happy about that at all."
826,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
827,2020-04-05,"No, I don't believe they're inflicting it. I think they could have given us a lot earlier notice, absolutely."
828,2020-04-05,"Please. Go ahead, please."
829,2020-04-05,Who are you asking with that question?
830,2020-04-05,"Because I see that they're very high. You know, if you look, I'm 95 percent in the Republican Party."
831,2020-04-05,"We just had a poll that was done by a very reputable group. We're — I'm beating Sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida — in the state of Florida and in other states. You know, so I don't really know who you're talking about."
832,2020-04-05,"All right. Jennifer, go ahead, please. Please."
833,2020-04-05,Yeah.
834,2020-04-05,"I did, and they explained to me where they're coming from. I mean, they went from, as I said, full planes — packed, the best year they've ever had, by far — to, boom — one day, empty — because of what we have to do to get rid of — to win this war or we would have a level of deaths like people haven't seen before."
835,2020-04-05,"So they've been fantastic. I mean, they've been great, but you know, they went from being extremely happy to being people that are running companies that are going to need some help. And we'll help them, Jennifer."
836,2020-04-05,"Well, it's going. I mean, there's a lot of influx to those loans, as you can imagine. A lot of people are looking at it. But we're going to be increasing funding a lot. They're very well prepared to do what they have to do and the SBA is doing a fantastic job. She is doing a really good job, the administrator."
837,2020-04-05,John?
838,2020-04-05,Yeah.
839,2020-04-05,"All right. Kaitlan, go ahead."
840,2020-04-05,Go ahead in the back. Please.
841,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
842,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
843,2020-04-05,"No, we're not seeing that at all."
844,2020-04-05,I wonder who said that.
845,2020-04-05,Do you know who said that?
846,2020-04-05,He used —
847,2020-04-05,Say the term again.
848,2020-04-05,"No, just the term."
849,2020-04-05,“Kung flu”?
850,2020-04-05,"No, not at all. No, not at all. I think they probably would agree with it 100 percent. It comes from China. There's nothing not to agree on."
851,2020-04-05,"Okay, how about the last question. Please, go ahead."
852,2020-04-05,Say it?
853,2020-04-05,"So my message is to all Americans, but to those Americans who are going through a lot: We love them, we're with them, and we will not let them down."
854,2020-04-05,Thank you all very much.
855,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. I think this is going to be a very important conference and I'll get to that toward the middle, but I have a few things to report. And I want to thank you all for being here."
856,2020-04-05,"And I have to say, I think with social distancing that the media has been much nicer. I don't know what it is — all these empty — these in-between chairs. We probably shouldn't have anybody sitting behind you either. You know, you should probably go back. But I love it. It's so much nicer. But I shouldn't say that because you'll get me now."
857,2020-04-05,"Thank you all for being here. And we continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus. Before I begin, I want to start by announcing that today we are bringing home another American citizen. It was a big thing. Very big. Amer Fakhoury is on his way back to the United States after being imprisoned in Lebanon since September of 2019. He's battling late-stage cancer. Mr. Fakhoury will now be able to receive the much-needed care and treatment in the United States. We've been working very hard to get him freed and he's finally able to have his entire family at his side."
858,2020-04-05,"So I'm very grateful to the Lebanese government. They worked with us. And we are very proud of his family. They stood by him so strongly, and they are thrilled."
859,2020-04-05,"The United States has no higher priority than the safety and wellbeing of our citizens. We've gotten a tremendous number of hostages out, as you know. I think we're 42-and-0. And Robert O'Brien, as you know, was our chief negotiator for a large part of it. In fact, did so well that now we have him in a different position."
860,2020-04-05,So I want to thank and congratulate Robert and his team and I want to let everyone know that recovering Americans held captive and imprisoned abroad continues to be a top priority for my administration.
861,2020-04-05,"We have one young gentleman, Austin Tice, and we're working very hard with Syria to get him out. We hope the Syrian government will do that. We are counting on them to do that. We've written a letter just recently, but he's been there for a long time and was captured long ago. Austin Tice. His mother is probably watching and she's a great lady. And we're doing the best we can. So, Syria, please work with us. And we would appreciate you letting him out."
862,2020-04-05,"If you think about what we've done, we've gotten rid of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. We've done a lot for Syria. We have to see if they're going to do this. So, it would be very much appreciated if they would let Austin Tice out immediately."
863,2020-04-05,"As you know, my administration is working every day to protect American people and the American economy from the virus. Yesterday, I signed into law a critical support for American workers, families, and small businesses. It was a big thing. We're providing sick leave and family medical leave to those affected by the virus and more help is on the way as we speak."
864,2020-04-05,"Our entire team, headed by Secretary Mnuchin, is on the Hill. We're working with Democrats and Republicans and there's a lot of goodwill going on. This was something that happened that was, some people would say, an act of God. I don't view it as an act of God; I would view it as is something that just surprised the whole world. And if people would have known about it, it could have stopped — been stopped in place. It could have been stopped right where it came from — China — if we would have known about it, if they would have known about it."
865,2020-04-05,"But now the whole world, almost, is inflicted with this horrible — with this horrible virus and it's too bad. It's too bad because we never had an economy as good as the economy we had just a few weeks ago."
866,2020-04-05,But we'll be back and I actually think we'll be back stronger than ever before because we learned a lot during this period of time.
867,2020-04-05,"I also just invoked the Defense Production Act to help facilitate distribution of essential supplies if necessary. We're working with Congress to provide major additional relief to the workers, small businesses, and the hardest-hit industries. We want to make sure that everybody is able to continue on so that when we recover, all of these companies and these great businesses — both very, very small and very, very large — are not going to be broken up and you'd have to put them back together. That would take a long time."
868,2020-04-05,Because we really believe in — I believe in the V curve. I believe it's going to go. When this is — when this is defeated — this hidden scourge is defeated — I think we're going to go up very rapidly — our economy — and get back to where it was and beyond.
869,2020-04-05,"Today, I want to share with you exciting progress that the FDA is making with the private sector as we slash red tape like nobody has ever done it before. Somebody was on yesterday, on one of the networks, and said that there's never been a President even close that's been able to do what I've done in slashing all of the red tape and everything to get very important things to the market — medical."
870,2020-04-05,"So we slashed red tape to develop vaccines and therapies as fast as it can possibly be done — long before anybody else was even thinking about doing this. And, as you know, earlier this week, we began the first clinical trial of a vaccine candidate for the virus, and that was launched in record time. It was just a few weeks. And that would have taken years to do, not so long ago."
871,2020-04-05,"As we race to develop a vaccine, we're also pursuing antiviral therapies. And that's what, really, we're going to be talking to you about today. That's the purpose of being up here today. And, to me, that's even more important. The vaccine, by its nature, you have to have long tests because you have to make sure what goes into somebody's body is not going to do destruction, do bad things. So you need long tests."
872,2020-04-05,"And they're doing great with the vaccines, but it's still a long process. But the therapies are something we can move on much faster, potentially, and the treatments that will be able to reduce the severity or duration of the symptoms — to make people better. Essentially, we're looking at things to make people better or, at the very earliest stages, they wouldn't even know they had it. And that's where I believe it's going to work even the best."
873,2020-04-05,"The FDA Commissioner — Stephen Hahn, who is with us — he's fantastic. And he has been working 24 hours a day. He's been — he's worked like, probably as hard or harder than anybody in this — in the group, other than maybe Mike Pence or me. And what the FDA is doing is incredible. They've done things in times that were not even thinkable and I've directed the FDA to eliminate outdated rules and bureaucracy so this work can proceed rapidly, quickly, and, I mean, fast."
874,2020-04-05,"And we have to remove every barrier. There are a lot of barriers that were unnecessary. And they've done that to get the rapid deployment of safe, effective treatments. And we think we have some good answers. We'll find out very, very soon."
875,2020-04-05,"Clinical trials are already underway for many new therapies and we're working on scaling these to allow many more Americans to access different drugs that have shown really good promise. We've had some un- — really good promise. We will do so in a way that lets us continue to collect good data, to know which medicines are safe and which medicines are working the best. We have a couple that we're — we're in really good shape on. And that's for immediate delivery — immediate — like as fast as we can get it."
876,2020-04-05,The FDA has also approved compassionate use for a significant number of patients. You know what that means. We're also reviewing drugs that are approved abroad or drugs approved here for other uses.
877,2020-04-05,"And, you know, one of the things that I'm most proud of that I got was Right to Try. That's where somebody who's ill, somebody who's very sick — terminally ill, usually. In past administrations — we signed this a year and a half ago — you wouldn't be able to even think about getting any of the drugs that may be showing great promise. Now — and they've been trying for many decades to get this approved and it sounds simple, but it's not because there's liability involved and lots of other things. And I was able to get it approved, working with Congress. Right to Try."
878,2020-04-05,"This is beyond Right to Try. What we're talking about today is beyond Right to Try. Right to Try has been, by the way, a tremendous success. People are living now that had no chance of living, where we take treatments that would — things that — that would have to go through years of a process. And if somebody was terminally ill — and I would say, “Why wouldn't they be able to try this?” They'd go to Asia, they'd go to Europe, they'd go all over the world to try and find something. Or some people, if they had no money, would go home to die. They'd go home to die; they had no hope."
879,2020-04-05,"Right to Try has been an incredible success. But this is beyond Right to Try. If treatments known to be safe in Europe, Japan, or other nations are effective against the virus, we'll use that information to protect the health and safety of American people. Nothing will stand in our way as we pursue any avenue to find what best works against this horrible virus."
880,2020-04-05,"Now, a drug called chloroquine — and some people would add to it “hydroxy-.” Hydroxychloroquine. So chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Now, this is a common malaria drug. It is also a drug used for strong arthritis. If somebody has pretty serious arthritis, also uses this in a somewhat different form. But it is known as a malaria drug, and it's been around for a long time and it's very powerful. But the nice part is, it's been around for a long time, so we know that if it — if things don't go as planned, it's not going to kill anybody."
881,2020-04-05,"When you go with a brand-new drug, you don't know that that's going to happen. You have to see and you have to go — long test. But this has been used in different forms — very powerful drug — in different forms. And it's shown very encouraging — very, very encouraging early results. And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately. And that's where the FDA has been so great. They — they've gone through the approval process; it's been approved. And they did it — they took it down from many, many months to immediate. So we're going to be able to make that drug available by prescription or states."
882,2020-04-05,"I spoke with Governor Cuomo about it at great length last night, and he wants to be right on — on the — he wants to be first on line. And so I think that's a tremendous — there's tremendous promise, based on the results and other tests. There's tremendous promise. And normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that, and it's — it was approved very, very quickly and it's now approved, by prescription. Individual states will handle it. They can handle it. Doctors will handle it. And I think it's going to be — I think it's going to be great."
883,2020-04-05,"Then we're quickly studying this drug, and while we're continuing to study it — but the studying is going to be also done in — as it's given out to large groups of people, perhaps in New York and other places. We'll study it there."
884,2020-04-05,"There are promising therapies produced by Gilead, and that's remdesivir. Remdesivir. And that's a drug used for other purposes that's been out and has had very good results for other purposes, but it seems to have a very good result, having to do with this virus. And that drug also has been approved or very close to approved, in that case, by the FDA."
885,2020-04-05,"And I can't tell you how much we appreciate what the FDA — these people are incredible patriots. And the job that Stephen Hahn is doing — Dr. Hahn, who is one of the most respected doctors in the country, by the way, where we took him. I said, “You sure you want to do this?” Now, we didn't know that this was going to be in the playlist, what happened here, but he really has stepped up to the plate, wherever you are. Where is he? You really have."
886,2020-04-05,"I'd shake his hand, but I'm not supposed to do that. I'd get in a lot of trouble if I did that. But he's been fantastic. And I thank you, Doctor. He's going to speak right after I'm finished."
887,2020-04-05,"So, Regeneron, again, and — is some — is a company that's done fantastically well, as I understand, with Ebola and some other things. Great company. And they're looking at some very promising events also. So you have remdesivir and you have chloroquine and hydro- — hydroxychloroquine. So those are two that are out now, essentially approved for prescribed use."
888,2020-04-05,"And I think it's going to be very exciting. I think it could be a game changer and maybe not. And maybe not. But I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer. Very powerful. They're very powerful."
889,2020-04-05,"So I want every American to know that we're doing everything we can. And these actions are important next steps. I mean, for the FDA to act the way they acted, with this kind of speed, is an incredible thing. Normally, they would say, “Well, we could have it by next year” or “We could have it by — in two years from now.” You understand. This is the way — normally, it's like years and years and years. They had it immediately, based on the fact that it's been used for other things — totally unrelated things."
890,2020-04-05,"We believe these therapeutics and others under evaluation right now will be able to provide relief to many Americans. We really hope that's going to be. This could be a tremendous breakthrough. Tremendous breakthrough. And we will work toward a much-needed vaccine in the future, as I said. And what we're doing with the FDA is so exciting in so many other fields. So many things are happening. It's a very exciting time for — for medicine."
891,2020-04-05,"And we appreciate that the American public has pulled together. They're really staying home. And I think there's tremendous spirit in this country right now, a spirit like a lot of people have not seen. People have not seen anything like it for a long time. And that means Democrat, Republican. They're pulling together. I hope everything is going good on the Hill. Maybe I shouldn't say this until I check out what's going on, because you never know. But — but I think there's a great spirit where the Democrats and the Republicans and everybody else, they're getting together and they're trying to get things done."
892,2020-04-05,"But most importantly, the American public has been incredible. We took the best economy we've ever had and we said “Stop. You can't work. You have to stay home.” You know, there's never been a case like this. Normally, you pay a lot of money to get things going. Here's a case we're paying a lot of money to stop things because we don't want people to be together so that this virus doesn't continue onward. So there's never been anything like this in history. There's never been a –nobody has ever seen anything like this."
893,2020-04-05,"But we're doing the right thing. We have to get rid — I mean, our big war is not a — it's not a financial war. It's a war — it's a medical war. And we have to win this war. It's very important."
894,2020-04-05,"With that, I'd like to just introduce Dr. Stephen Hahn. And he — again, I'd like to send back with Stephen our thanks to all of the people working in the FDA who are fantastic, talented people. We appreciate it very much, everything you've done, especially the speed that you got these two elements, these two very important drugs passed. Thank you very much. Thank you, Stephen."
895,2020-04-05,Thank you.
896,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much."
897,2020-04-05,"Mike? Talk about the masks, maybe."
898,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much."
899,2020-04-05,"Doctor, please."
900,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Doctor, very much."
901,2020-04-05,Jerome? Please.
902,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Jerome. Thank you."
903,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Go ahead, Jon."
904,2020-04-05,"Well, we don't want that. In fact, some companies, as you know, did stock buybacks, and I was never happy with that. It's very hard to tell them not to, but I would tell them not to. I would say I don't like it for that reason. Some did, and it turned out that they could have waited a long time. It would have been much better off if they didn't."
905,2020-04-05,"I'm mind making — I mean, you know, it takes many, many people, in this case, to tango. But as far as I'm concerned, that — conditions like that would be okay with me."
906,2020-04-05,John?
907,2020-04-05,"No, because we hope we're not going to need that."
908,2020-04-05,"First of all, governors are supposed to be doing a lot of this work, and they are doing a lot of this work. The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping. You know, we're not a shipping clerk. The governors are supposed to be — as with testing, the governors are supposed — are supposed to be doing it."
909,2020-04-05,"We'll help out, and we'll help out wherever we can. And we can buy in volume and, in some cases, great volume — with the masks, as an example, which were really a problem. We have helped out, and there are right now millions of masks being made. But this is really for the local governments, governors, and people within the state, depending on the way they divided it up. And they'll do that, and they're doing a very good job of it."
910,2020-04-05,"Where you have a problem with ventilators, we're working very hard trying to find — nobody in their wildest dreams would have ever thought that we'd need tens of thousands of ventilators. This is something that's very unique to this, to what happened."
911,2020-04-05,"Well, if we were desperately in need of something — and we, frankly, will know about that very shortly. We want to be ahead of — we don't want to do it as it happens but before it happens. We're going to know a lot over the next two or three days. We'll know a lot."
912,2020-04-05,"No, I'm not. But we're trying to find that out. This has been going on for years. Many years, they've been trying to find Austin Tice. He was in Syria, as you know. His mother is an incredible woman. And I'm doing it for him, but I'm doing it for his mother. His mother is an incredible woman who is desperate to find her son. And I'm not confirming alive, but if — if he is alive, we would like very much to get him back quickly."
913,2020-04-05,"Well, I haven't seen that, but I will let Mike answer that question. Vice President?"
914,2020-04-05,"So how many masks are being made? And when will they be ready, or at least we start getting them ready?"
915,2020-04-05,Some of that had to do with the liability to the company. They had a big problem with liability.
916,2020-04-05,And much of it had to do with the liability to the company.
917,2020-04-05,"We're looking at that issue directly with them, and that's a separate issue. But we're looking at that issue very directly."
918,2020-04-05,We're looking at it very directly.
919,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to do our best on it. But we're working with Democrats and Republicans on that. We're looking at that very specifically,"
920,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I hope very soon. We'll see. This is uncharted territory, as you know. We think we have ideas. It doesn't help to say what the idea is. I would hope very soon. We're — we've pulled together as a nation. People are, for the most part, doing what they're supposed to be doing."
921,2020-04-05,The social distancing is very interesting. A whole new term that's become a hot — it's become somewhat of a hot term. But people are listening and they're — and they're really doing a great job. This country is an amazing country.
922,2020-04-05,I think you're up to 141 different countries right now. So it's very uncharted territory. Could have — could have been stopped — could have been stopped pretty easily if we had known — if everybody had known about it a number of months before people started reading about it.
923,2020-04-05,"Excuse me. Excuse me. Before we started reading about it. We could have — it could have been stopped in its tracks. Unfortunately, they didn't decide to make it public. But the whole world is suffering because of it."
924,2020-04-05,"We were very prepared. The only thing we weren't prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly. I'll tell you how prepared I was: I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was — in fact, it was your network — I believe they called me a racist because I did that. It was — many of the people in the room, they called me racist and other words because I did that, because I went so early."
925,2020-04-05,"So when you say we weren't prepared, had I let these tens of thousands of people come in from China a day, we would have had something right now that would have been — you wouldn't have even recognized it compared to where we are. How many people have passed away? How many people have died as of this moment? You could multiply that by a factor of many, many, many."
926,2020-04-05,"So when you say that I wasn't prepared, I was the first one to do the ban. Now other countries are following what I did. But the media doesn't acknowledge that. They know it's true —"
927,2020-04-05,"They know it's true, but they don't want to write about it."
928,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead."
929,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
930,2020-04-05,Governors are supposed to get it. The states are supposed to get it. But we're helping the states.
931,2020-04-05,"Well — look, for years, they bought them, and now, all of a sudden, they're coming to the federal government."
932,2020-04-05,We are working with the states. We're working with the governors. We're working with everybody. The relationships are great.
933,2020-04-05,"One of the things that happened this morning: I spoke with Micky Arison of Carnival Cruise Lines, and he's going to make ships available. So in addition to the big medical ships that you have coming, if we should need ships with lots of rooms, they'll be docked at New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco — different places. So I want to thank Micky Arison; that's Carnival Cruise Lines."
934,2020-04-05,I've done it. I've done it.
935,2020-04-05,"Yeah, if we find that we need something, that we will do that. And you don't know what we've done. You don't know whether or not we've ordered. You don't know if we've invoked it. You don't know what's been ordered, what's not been ordered."
936,2020-04-05,"I can only tell you — I can only tell you that, as an example, masks — nobody ever heard of the number of masks that's been ordered. They're being made now, and many are available now. But people, I think, in the media, probably don't know that."
937,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Behind.
938,2020-04-05,"Well, we don't want to pick winners and losers. We want everybody to benefit. We want, I think more than anything else, the workers to benefit. And sometimes for the worker to benefit, you have to go through the company because they have thousands of workers. And if the company goes out of business — no fault of their own — those workers aren't going to be able to receive a check."
939,2020-04-05,"So we're — look, our ultimate goal are the people. Our ultimate goal are the great people of this country. And we will have things worked out, I think, that are going to be very well. It's a very complex formula; you understand that. It's very complex. But it's working out. I think it's going to be very well. I think we're going to have pretty uniform support for it."
940,2020-04-05,Please.
941,2020-04-05,We're speaking with the State Department later. I can't say right now because I haven't had the meeting yet.
942,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
943,2020-04-05,Yeah. Please.
944,2020-04-05,Jeff.
945,2020-04-05,I can only tell you on the 14th day. And we'll have to see. We'll have indications later on.
946,2020-04-05,"I think they actually are doing a lot. I mean, they — I know New York is working very diligently, been very strong. I assume San Francisco is one of the areas, and Los Angeles, and the State of Washington, obviously; that's one that has to be up there. They're all working very hard to quarantine or where it's just about the equivalent of quarantine. Okay?"
947,2020-04-05,"We are. And we're doing — we're using the medical term of “telemedicine,” and it's been incredibly busy and, really, you know, where people don't have to — I mean, some people can't do it anyway. They can't get up; they can't see a doctor. But we're using this, and it's been telehealth — different names. And I will tell you that it's been really successful, and it's helped a lot of people out, where they don't have to and they can't. And even from a safety reason, if they are positive, they are — if they are feeling poorly, they can't do it, or we don't want them transmitting anything to anybody else."
948,2020-04-05,"Well, it would have been much better if we had known about this a number of months earlier. It could have been contained to that one area in China where it started. And certainly, the world is paying a big price for what they did and the world is paying a very big price for not — for not letting them come out. Everybody knows that. We all know that."
949,2020-04-05,As far as —
950,2020-04-05,"— as far as believing what they're putting out now, I hope it's true. Who knows? But I hope it's true. I really do."
951,2020-04-05,Big difference.
952,2020-04-05,I don't want to comment on that right now.
953,2020-04-05,Yeah.
954,2020-04-05,"No. Worst-case scenario, you would have terrible job numbers. If we can get this thing wrapped up and finished earlier, things will go very nicely. And one of the things they're working — as you know, one of the elements that is being worked on very much so on the Hill is to keep the jobs going so that when we do get rid of the virus, we're going to be able to just really, I think, go like a rocket. I think the economy is going to be fantastic."
955,2020-04-05,"No, when he said that, he was using that as the ultimate bad outcome. I don't think anybody believes that's going to happen."
956,2020-04-05,Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead. You.
957,2020-04-05,"I know all of them. And I don't know if they're sitting like you people are sitting — you're actually sitting too close. You should — really, we should probably get rid of about another 75, 80 percent of you. I'll just have two or three that I like in this room. I think that's a great way of doing it. We just figured a new way of doing it. But you're actually much too close. You know, you two, you should leave immediately."
958,2020-04-05,"But — but, look — look, I know all of them. They tested positive. Hopefully, they're all going to get better. And it's one of those things. It's Congress, you know? It's one of those things."
959,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't think they're going to the Hill. I mean, I know some, where they tested positive, they're in quarantine. And I know Lindsey and many others are — they didn't test, but until they got the result, they put themselves in quarantine."
960,2020-04-05,"A number of people in Congress right now are in quarantine; they don't know the results. When they get the result, they'll either stay there and get better — because people get better. I mean, most people are getting better. Most, by far — the people — you get better. Doesn't mean it's not a tough one; it is a tough one."
961,2020-04-05,"But no, when they — many people in Congress have felt not perfect or they met somebody that wasn't perfect and turned out to be positive, and they've put themselves in quarantine."
962,2020-04-05,"No, I think they've — I think Congress has behaved unbelievably well in that regard."
963,2020-04-05,"We'll know about that later on. We'll see what happens. It depends how long — so much depends on what's going on in this room, in terms of the medical. If can stop it in its tracks, the virus, it's plenty. If we can't, we'll have to go back and talk."
964,2020-04-05,I do. I really do.
965,2020-04-05,"I will — I'm not going to say, but I think so. Look, people are coming — people are coming in for money. In some cases, no fault of their own. But in some cases, where they did certain things over the course of the years, including buying back stock — you know, they bought back stock and they paid a higher price for it, as it turned out."
966,2020-04-05,"But maybe I view that as a little bit differently than somebody that didn't and somebody that built plants all over the United States, of which there were plenty of them too."
967,2020-04-05,"We will be helping the airline industry. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry. We'll probably be — where — where jobs are created, you don't want to lose industries like this. These are incredible industries. You can't lose them. So we'll focus on many industries."
968,2020-04-05,"And I have to say — I can't state it strongly enough: We will be helping small businesses. That's where it's complicated, because there's a lot of small — you know, that's the engine of the — of the country. We will be helping small businesses."
969,2020-04-05,No.
970,2020-04-05,"There could be. We're looking at a couple of things that I could do. Hopefully won't need it, but we can do what —"
971,2020-04-05,"There's a lot of executive power. If we don't have to use it, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing."
972,2020-04-05,Yeah. Please.
973,2020-04-05,Thanks for telling us. We appreciate it.
974,2020-04-05,Go ahead. What's the rest of your question? We know that. Everybody in the room knows that.
975,2020-04-05,We'll be able to tell you that very — I think in the near future. We'll see where we're going. You're going to see numbers. You've seen the graphs. You're going to see numbers and we'll be able to let you know.
976,2020-04-05,"I will say that the American public has been incredible, for the most part — not in all cases, but for the most part. So you'll be able to see what's happening over the next — as we say, we had a 15-day period. You'll be able to tell a lot in a week or so — not everything, but we'll be able to see over a period of time."
977,2020-04-05,"And I have to say, if chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine works — or any of the other things that they're looking at that are not quite as far out — but if they work, your numbers are going to come down very rapidly. So we'll see what happens. But there's a real chance that they might — they might work."
978,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please. In the back."
979,2020-04-05,"Well, he's a friend of mine, number one. And number two, we had dinner the other night and everybody said he was positive, and he wasn't positive. He tested negative. So that was — I was quite happy when I heard that."
980,2020-04-05,But I have no message for him other than he's doing a good job in Brazil.
981,2020-04-05,"He's doing a good job in Brazil, and he's very popular."
982,2020-04-05,I can't tell you about that. I don't know about that. I have not heard that.
983,2020-04-05,He's doing a very good job. Brazil was very troubled before he got there. And he's — the people love them and he's popular. I think he's a very good job.
984,2020-04-05,In Peru?
985,2020-04-05,Where? Where? Where?
986,2020-04-05,"Yep, we know about it. We have groups. We have a group of young people in Peru and we're working on taking care of that with the military."
987,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we're looking to take — no, not evacuation. We're —"
988,2020-04-05,"We're trying to get them out. And you know, they got caught. They were late with their flights. We gave them a period of time; they didn't make it. But we're looking to get them out with military — probably through the military."
989,2020-04-05,"We have a group of young — young people — I think young men or young people — could be women also with them — from Alabama. The great State of Alabama. And they're in Peru and we're working on that right now, trying to get them out. It's a large group. It's about 300. We'll — we're going to work it out."
990,2020-04-05,Jeff.
991,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we did discuss it. As you know, Prime Minister Abe was on the call and that's a big decision for him. And we don't know what his decision is, but we would live with his decision. It's a tough situation. They've done an incredible job. Japan has done an incredible job on building the venues — getting them built. You know, you've seen so many Olympic venues that have been a disaster over the years, where they cost five times more than they were supposed to and they weren't ready on time."
992,2020-04-05,Japan has been just the opposite. They built it beautifully. They built it for what it was supposed to be built for. But then he got hit with the same thing that the rest of the world got hit with unexpectedly.
993,2020-04-05,He has — he has told us that he has not made a decision as to what to do.
994,2020-04-05,"Well, the one thing I will tell you is that from the standpoint — you always get a little bit torn because, you know, until we became the leading producer, I was always for the person driving the car and filling up the tank of gas. And you'd have gasoline and the prices were — if they were too high, I would always raise hell with OPEC. And I was always somebody that likes — you know, I never thought I'd see 22 and 24 and $28 a barrel, but that's what we have."
995,2020-04-05,"And, in one way, our consumer is very much helped. It's like — it's like a massive tax increase. That's bigger than any tax increase — decrease that you could give. You know, we can give all these big tax cuts, but they're paying so little for gasoline. But, on the other hand, it hurts a great industry and a very powerful industry."
996,2020-04-05,"So, I spoke with numerous people that have a lot to do with it and we have a lot of power over the situation. And we're trying to find some kind of a medium ground."
997,2020-04-05,"You know, it's very devastating to Russia, because when you look — I mean, their whole economy is based on that. And they have — we have the lowest oil prices in decades. So it's very devastating to Russia. I would say it's very bad for Saudi Arabia, but they were in a fight. They were in a fight on price. They were in a fight on output. And at the — at the appropriate time, I'll get involved. Yeah."
998,2020-04-05,"Well, Micky called up, and he said, “If you need them...” And we haven't said yes. I'll call Governor Cuomo. I'll call Gavin from — Gavin Newsom, governor from California. I'll call a few of the other governors. They're going to bring it up today, because we're meeting, through phone — through telephone — “telephonically,” as they say — in a little while at FEMA. I'm going to go to FEMA from here."
999,2020-04-05,"Well, you could increase places to stay. Let's say “places to stay.” If it works — I mean, you know, I don't know, maybe people won't want them."
1000,2020-04-05,"But he made the offer. It was a very generous offer. And he said that he has some ships that would be ideally suited for what we're doing. And certainly, they have a lot of rooms. They're big and they have a lot of rooms. So we appreciate it from Carnival."
1001,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1002,2020-04-05,Not needing the tests?
1003,2020-04-05,"Well, no, you should only get —"
1004,2020-04-05,"You should — I didn't have any symptoms and I got a test. But I got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy. So that's the only reason. I had no symptoms but I had a test. And my doctor told me, “Don't get it. You don't need it.” Everybody said, “You don't need it.” But I had to do it because the press was going crazy."
1005,2020-04-05,"And then, after I got it, they said “You shouldn't have gotten it. You had no symptoms.” You know, the whole thing. So, in other words, if you get it, it was no good. But that's — I'm a unique case, unfortunately."
1006,2020-04-05,"But, no, people that don't show symptoms and people that have doctors that say they shouldn't get it — I would rely on that. Yeah, I would rely on that."
1007,2020-04-05,OAN.
1008,2020-04-05,Very good. Thank you very much. They treat me very nicely. Go ahead.
1009,2020-04-05,No.
1010,2020-04-05,"No, I don't think it's racist."
1011,2020-04-05,I don't think it's racist at all.
1012,2020-04-05,"It amazes me when I read the things that I read. It amazes me when I read the Wall Street Journal, which is always so negative. It amazes me when I read the New York Times. It's not even — I don't — I barely read it. You know, we don't distribute it in the White House anymore, and the same thing with the Washington Post. Because, you see, I know the truth. And people out there in the world, they really don't know the truth. They don't know what it is. They use different slogans and different concepts for me almost every week, trying to catch something."
1013,2020-04-05,"Last week, it was all chaos. You see me. There's no chaos. I have no chaos. I'm the one telling everybody to be calm. There's no chaos at the White House. We have unbelievable professionals. It's really — I mean, I think I came up with the term — I hope I came up with the term — but it is fake news. It's more than fake news; it's corrupt news. They write stories without calling anybody. They write a story — today, I had a couple of stories where they — they never call me ever, that I know of. At least nobody tells me. They'll write a story about me without even asking my opinion on something. It's totally fake."
1014,2020-04-05,"I've never seen — I mean, there is a story in the Wall Street Journal today about — you know, about how we've done. We've done a phenomenal job on this. The governors are even — even Gavin Newsom, who you know I'm usually fighting with over the fires and — “I think you should do a different kind of a job at the — in the forests,” and lots of things. We argue a lot. But Gavin Newsom has been very, very generous — generous. Andrew Cuomo has been, really, very generous. I mean, they're saying we're doing a great job, and everybody saying."
1015,2020-04-05,"But then you read this phony story in the Wall Street Journal or — the Washington Post is going wild lately. I don't know what happened to them. I guess, something happened like we don't call them back or whatever."
1016,2020-04-05,"But the Washington Post — these are very dishonest media sources. They're very dishonest. And you know what? Someday, hopefully in five years, I won't be here and that'll be fine. I will have done, I think, a great job, because I don't think anyone has done as much in three and a half years as I've done, I don't think — and the administration. This administration has done a great job. But the press is very dishonest."
1017,2020-04-05,"Well, I think they do. I mean — I mean, they are siding with — they are siding with China. They are doing things that they shouldn't be doing. They're siding with many others, China's the least of it. So why — why they're doing this, you'll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place."
1018,2020-04-05,"So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We are very excited about — we are very excited about — you know, specifically, what we talked about with the chloroquine. I think the — I think it could be something really incredible. It could totally depress the times that we had mentioned."
1019,2020-04-05,"Wait. Excuse me. Excuse me. It could totally depress any time that we're talking about, if it works. There are a lot of reasons that I have to believe — again, Dr. Hahn is the expert, but a lot of reasons that I would have to think that it could have a very positive effect or a positive effect. Maybe not very, but maybe — maybe positive. I think it's, to me, very, very exciting."
1020,2020-04-05,"And the beauty is — I think I can say this, Steve — the beauty is that these drugs have been out there. So the really danger part of the drugs — especially chloroquine — it's been out there for years. So we know it's something that can be taken safely. So it's very important."
1021,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Go ahead.
1022,2020-04-05,And they are. And they are.
1023,2020-04-05,"We're going to have other times to meet. We'll be meeting, hopefully, not for very long. I mean, I would like to see this get cleared up, and we think we've — to me, this was a very important conference because I really think there's great potential here. And a lot of people are going to be trying it soon — like, literally, very soon. Literally, in a matter of days, if not sooner, in some cases. It's already being experimented with, and there's been some very good results."
1024,2020-04-05,"We'll see what happens. But if — if we can be even partially right — maybe we'll be fully right — but even partially right on it, this whole subject becomes a much more pleasant subject."
1025,2020-04-05,"So, thank you all, and we'll — we're going over to FEMA now. So, I don't know who's going, but we're going to FEMA. We're going to be discussing with the governors and lots of other people."
1026,2020-04-05,"Now — well, I think that's enough. Thank you."
1027,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. So, America continues to wage all-out war to defeat the virus — this horrible, horrible virus. You see how terrible it is, especially when you look at the numbers from yesterday. And we explained why we're extending our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread by 30 days."
1028,2020-04-05,"Together, we have the power to save countless lives. We're attacking the virus on every front with social distancing, economic support for our workers, rapid medical intervention, and very serious innovation, and banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people. And we did that early — far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else."
1029,2020-04-05,"In this time of need, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us to achieve a total victory. As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there's a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists, and other malign actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain. And we must not let that happen. We will never let that happen."
1030,2020-04-05,"Today, the United States is launching enhanced counter-narcotics operations in the Western Hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics. We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives."
1031,2020-04-05,"In cooperation with the 22 partner nations, U.S. Southern Command will increase surveillance, disruption, and seizures of drug shipments and provide additional support for eradication efforts which are going on right now at a record pace. We're deploying additional Navy destroyers, combat ships, aircraft, and helicopters; Coast Guard cutters; and Air Force surveillance aircraft, doubling our capabilities in the region. Very importantly, our forces are fully equipped with personnel protective equipment, and we've taken additional safety measures to ensure our troops remain healthy."
1032,2020-04-05,"Secretary Mark Esper, Attorney General Bill Barr, National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien will provide more details. In addition, I'm going to have General Milley, who has done an incredible job in so many ways, say a few words. And also with us: our Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gilday, who you know — I think you know; and Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz. So I'm going to ask Mark to start and then we can go. And after that, we're going to take questions as it pertains to this. And then we'll go onto phase two, which is the virus itself. Okay?"
1033,2020-04-05,"Thank you, please. Mark."
1034,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, General. Beautiful. Thank you. Bill."
1035,2020-04-05,Okay. So do we have any questions on this? Because this group is going to go back to work. They're going to leave.
1036,2020-04-05,"John, please."
1037,2020-04-05,"Well, for a long time, we've had a lot of drugs coming into our country. And it's not that it's increased, it's prob- — we've probably got it down a little bit, but it's still a tremendous number. Families are being ruined. Lives are being ruined. It's an incredible thing, especially as you're at this position. You would never believe it. I see things that nobody would believe. I see reports that nobody would believe."
1038,2020-04-05,"So I met with the group behind me, all of them, and we said, “What do you think we can do?” And they think they can interdict. They think we can stop it before it gets to the shores. And they're coming from all over the place. And we have incredibly talented people."
1039,2020-04-05,So I think I'm going to let Mark just give a little bit of an answer to that. But we just want to see if we can stop a big — a good percentage of the drugs coming into our country.
1040,2020-04-05,"And, you know, we didn't do it for this reason, but it'll also have an impact on the virus because we have people trying to get in. So not only drugs, but now we have a new phenomena. And that's at least for the next hopefully short period of time — the virus. So we'll be able to have an effect on that too."
1041,2020-04-05,Please.
1042,2020-04-05,That's right. They were.
1043,2020-04-05,"Well, because we're focused on so many other parts of the country, and even parts of the world. And, all of a sudden, areas where we — we had it clamped down pretty tight — in all fairness."
1044,2020-04-05,"You know, the wall is up to about 160 miles already. And any areas where we have that wall, it's, for the most part, contiguous. We have fill-ins. But we're up to 161 miles exactly."
1045,2020-04-05,"And any place where you have that wall, other than walking around it on the edges, it's stopping everybody cold. I mean, we're stopping — we're — nobody has seen anything like it. That's how good it works. And the other side knew it worked that well — everybody. Because everybody was for it five years ago. All of a sudden, they changed. It's having a tremendous impact."
1046,2020-04-05,"But we are now focused on so many different things because of what's happened, because of this horrible — I say it's a horrible phenomena that now we've got to focus on drugs. And the drugs come in from different methods. And we have the best people at sea anywhere in the world, so we'll have a tremendous impact on drugs."
1047,2020-04-05,"But one of the other things: We'll also have an impact, we think on the — on the virus."
1048,2020-04-05,Okay? Yeah. Please.
1049,2020-04-05,"We really don't know. I mean, yeah — look, how do we know whether if they underreported or reported however they report?"
1050,2020-04-05,"But we had a great call the other night. We're working together on a lot of different things, including trade. They're buying a lot. They're spending a lot of money and they're giving it to our farmers. They're paying our farmers for the product. So, you know, we're going to — we're going to continue that along."
1051,2020-04-05,John. Yeah.
1052,2020-04-05,"I know what you're saying, but we just have information that they were planning something. And it's very good information. It was led by Iran — not necessarily Iran, but by groups supported by Iran. But that, to me, is Iran. And we're just saying, “Don't do it. Don't do it.” It would be a very bad thing for them if they did it."
1053,2020-04-05,"That was a very powerful response, by the way. That response knocked out five different places, but it also took out a lot of very bad people."
1054,2020-04-05,"Well, that was a very big response. You know, we knocked out a lot. We looked — they hit one site; we hit five big ones and ammunition sites. You saw the — you saw what happened. And I won't say how many people were killed, but some bad people were killed. And a lot of them. That was a big response. But this response will be bigger if they do something."
1055,2020-04-05,Yeah. You had one. Please.
1056,2020-04-05,"We have not received that. But their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side. And I'm being nice when I say that, relative to what we witnessed and what was reported."
1057,2020-04-05,"But we discussed that with him — not so much the numbers, as what they did and how they're doing. And we're in constant communication with — I mean, I would say the biggest communication is myself and President Xi. The relationship is very good."
1058,2020-04-05,"We have — look, they're spending — they will be spending, when things even out — this is obviously a little bit of a hurdle, what's happened over the last month. But they'll be spending $250 billion, buying our product: $50 billion to the farmers alone, $200 billion to other things. They never did that before. So we have a great trade deal. And we'd like to keep it, they'd like to keep it, and the relationship is good."
1059,2020-04-05,"As to whether or not their numbers are accurate, I'm not an accountant from China."
1060,2020-04-05,"No, because people just don't know. People don't know where did it come from. I think we all understand where it came from. And President Xi understands that. And we don't have to make a big deal out of it."
1061,2020-04-05,"We didn't like the fact that they said it came from our soldiers. And they haven't pursued that. It was — and that was a mid-level person said that. That was not a high-level person, so I assume. I will always assume the best. I'll assume the high-level people didn't know about it. It was a foolish statement."
1062,2020-04-05,"So, look, the relationship with China is a good one, and my relationship with him is, you know, really good."
1063,2020-04-05,Please.
1064,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1065,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't mind if they want it. Yeah. I view that as a positive, if they're helping other countries. We have 151 countries right now that are under siege by the virus. Under siege. Some are doing really badly. You know, they don't know about social distancing. These are countries that aren't highly sophisticated. They don't have great communication with the rest of the world. I mean, they don't know the things that we're doing and that some others are able to do."
1066,2020-04-05,"And if China can help them, I'm all for it. I'm for all of us helping everybody. We're soon going to have more ventilators than we need. We're building thousands of ventilators right now. Now, it takes a period of time to build them. And again, nobody could have known a thing like this could happen. We're building thousands. We will fairly soon be at a point where we have far more than we can use, even after we stockpile for some future catastrophe, which we hope doesn't happen."
1067,2020-04-05,"We're going to be distributing them — the extras — around the world. We'll go to Italy, we'll go to France. It will go to Spain, which is, you know, very hard hit."
1068,2020-04-05,"No. No, truth whatsoever."
1069,2020-04-05,"No, we want — I would love China and other countries, if they have additional supplies, medical supplies, to give to other countries. A hundred and fifty-one — 151 —"
1070,2020-04-05,Why would I stop that? Wouldn't that be terrible to stop it?
1071,2020-04-05,"No. Whatever we have, whatever we've committed to, we commit. But we also need a lot for ourselves, so we're very focused on that until we get over this. So obviously, we're not going to be shipping too much until — now, we do have excess of certain things, and we don't have enough of others."
1072,2020-04-05,"I just had a great talk today with the — Doug McMillon, from Walmart. And I gave him a very, very big order to — for gowns, for protective gear for the doctors, for the nurses, for everything. And he's actually very excited about it. He's the biggest purchaser of this kind of thing. I mean, of anything probably in the world. And he is very excited about it."
1073,2020-04-05,"And he said, “What size?” I said, “It's almost unlimited.” When you look at these hospitals, the amount that they order, you almost say, “How could they possibly use so much, whether it's masks or the protective gear?” But we are supplying a tremendous amount, and we just ordered a lot from Walmart. And he's taken this on personally. And I said, “Let it go ship — let it be shipped not to a warehouse, directly to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it,” because we save a lot of time when we do that."
1074,2020-04-05,"So Walmart, in addition to many other companies and people, is now involved at the highest level."
1075,2020-04-05,Please.
1076,2020-04-05,"No, I don't think we're losing ground, but we don't want to lose ground. That's why we're doing it. I don't want to lose ground. That's a big fight."
1077,2020-04-05,"I've seen many families where they're wiped out because they lost a son or a daughter, or a husband or a wife, or whatever — or all of them. And we don't want to lose ground. And we are heavily focused on the virus. Very heavily focused. And with this, we have never — after this goes into effect, which essentially is now, we will never have been so focused on drugs coming into our country as we are right now."
1078,2020-04-05,"And remember, as that wall gets bigger, that really helps us a lot. It really helps us a lot."
1079,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
1080,2020-04-05,"Many of the governments are, and Mexico, in particular, is. And Mexico, right now, has — we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border, keeping people out of our country. And we're — very few people are coming into our country right now."
1081,2020-04-05,"And as we complete, again, the wall, in addition to the 27,000 soldiers, it's — it's a very — it's a very tough place to come into. When I — when I took over, people were coming in and they were bringing whatever they wanted. They were bringing drugs of any type, and now it's very hard for them. And it will get harder and harder."
1082,2020-04-05,"But the President of Mexico is a great guy who's really helped us a lot: 27,000 soldiers — 27,000 Mexican soldiers."
1083,2020-04-05,"And you remember when I first took over, they had all of the caravans coming up with 10,000, 15,000 people in the caravans. They were marching through Mexico. That's not happening anymore."
1084,2020-04-05,"Please, in the back."
1085,2020-04-05,"I cannot tell you that. I can — I know the answer to that. I believe I do. But I cannot tell you that. We have information that would lead us to believe something very powerfully, but I cannot tell you the answer to that."
1086,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Jeff."
1087,2020-04-05,"Yeah, sure. Sure."
1088,2020-04-05,"They're taking precautions, and we are watching it very closely. And if something bad happens, it's going to be very painful for the other side."
1089,2020-04-05,"They know about it, yeah. They know about it."
1090,2020-04-05,"Well, we'll see. We'll see what happens. But, you know, we're down to a small force now. Over the years since I got — we've been bringing smaller and smaller. And we're down right now to a small number, but we have very powerful airpower there. We have the big base, and — which will — you know, I mean, nobody can get near it. Nobody can even get near that. But we've really, largely, left. You know, we've taken tremendous amounts out and we've deployed them elsewhere, including bringing some back home."
1091,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I think it's — it's not tweeting."
1092,2020-04-05,"It's called “social media.” It's social media. It gets out. I have, you know, hundreds of millions of people. Number one on Facebook. Did you know I was number one on Facebook? I mean, I just found out I'm number one on Facebook. I thought that was very nice for whatever it means."
1093,2020-04-05,"No, it represents something. And when I can explain to people: Just don't do it. You know, it's going to be bad if you do it. It's going to be really bad. And they don't need to do it. They have enough problems. Iran has enough problems without doing that."
1094,2020-04-05,"But we've been pulling back very substantially over the last year, in Iraq. And so, you know, that's the way it is."
1095,2020-04-05,No. I'm just giving them a warning. It's not a heads up. I'm giving them a warning. There's a big difference. I'm saying: If you do anything to hurt our troops they're going to — they're going to pay a price.
1096,2020-04-05,"No, they did last time, you know, as per the question. They did last time. We didn't make a big deal out of it, but we hit very, very hard five massive, major ammunition sites, and a lot of people went with it. A lot of bad people. A lot of enemy went with it. And we didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but they paid a big price. They'll pay a much bigger price this time if they do anything."
1097,2020-04-05,Sure.
1098,2020-04-05,And not too many people are going to be getting off at various ports anymore. Right?
1099,2020-04-05,I think we —
1100,2020-04-05,We probably have decided on that. Okay?
1101,2020-04-05,"Thank you. No — military people, from the ships."
1102,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1103,2020-04-05,It is —
1104,2020-04-05,— because we're sending it directly to hospitals. We don't want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it after it arrives and bring it to various states and hospitals.
1105,2020-04-05,"One of the things — and again, we asked the state to do this as much as possible — many of the states have people that — whether it's that or clothing; they make clothing — lots of clothing in many of the different states. We said, “See if you can get it directly from those manufacturers. Make a deal.” We'll use the Purchase Act, if we have to, on them. If they won't — by the way, so many people are — the spirit is incredible, what they're doing."
1106,2020-04-05,"But we've asked states where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, those local plants, and have it made directly. Ship it right into the hospitals."
1107,2020-04-05,"We're shipping things right in. We have, as you know, almost 10,000 ventilators, which we need for flexibility. It's a lot. It sounds like a lot, but it's not. Because, as you see on the board from yesterday, as this scourge, as this plague, as this virus moves — it moves very fast — and we don't know yet whether we're going to need it in Louisiana, in New York, you know, wherever it may be. So we're ready for it. We're totally ready for it."
1108,2020-04-05,"We're going to be shipping out — we've already agreed to ship out over 1,000 today to different sites, different locations. But we have to have the flexibility of moving the ventilators to where — to where the virus is going. And we'll be able to see that — you know, we'll be able to see that from charts a couple of days in advance."
1109,2020-04-05,"So right now we have a nice pile of ventilators. We have a lot more coming in. We have a lot of — I think we have 11 companies that are making ventilators right now. Very good companies. And they're making them — you know about Ford, you know about General Motors, but we have a lot of companies making the ventilators right now."
1110,2020-04-05,"So now, the question is — you know, when you make one, it doesn't get made in 15 minutes. It's not — a mask can go quickly; a ventilator takes time to build. It's very, very — as we discussed, it's complex, it's big, it's expensive — you know, et cetera. But we'll be able to move. We have great flexibility."
1111,2020-04-05,John?
1112,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I think if — does anybody have any other questions for this great group of brilliant people?"
1113,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
1114,2020-04-05,"And we're looking at doing two additional brand-new hospital ships because these ships have really — I mean, they really struck a blow — a very positive blow for what they're doing going into Los Angeles, going into New York."
1115,2020-04-05,So we're looking very seriously at building two additional ships of about the same size.
1116,2020-04-05,"It'll either be — well, building. But we're looking at building either two new ones or doing the renovation of another large ship. But this has really worked out well. So, probably two brand-new ones."
1117,2020-04-05,"Is this concerning the gentlemen, or do you want them —"
1118,2020-04-05,You don't want them to get back to work and capture all those bad people?
1119,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Sure. Go ahead.
1120,2020-04-05,True.
1121,2020-04-05,"Yes, we are."
1122,2020-04-05,"In fact, certain hospitals — yeah, certain hosp- — it can move very quickly. He's a very capable man. We're ready to move very quickly. As an example, in Louisiana, they have a very big hospital, so we're looking to move very quickly if we need them. You know, hopefully we won't need them."
1123,2020-04-05,"We're going to find out pretty soon. We're only going to know when — at the time it happens. We prepare for the worst. We are preparing for the worst. Unfortunately, that's the way we have to look at it."
1124,2020-04-05,"Well, as I understand, they're not doing that on the ship. That's the one thing they're not doing, outside of the COVID-19. They're not doing that. The birth of a baby — not being done on the ships."
1125,2020-04-05,"Good. Any other questions? Please, go ahead."
1126,2020-04-05,One more. One more for this group I have right here please.
1127,2020-04-05,"And I happen to think they want to make a deal; they just don't know, really, how to start. And they've been given some bad advice by former Secretary Kerry. It's some very bad advice."
1128,2020-04-05,"And I really think they want to make a deal — which is the Logan Act, but we'd have to look at the Logan Act. All you have to do is take a look. I think they've been given very bad advice by Secretary Kerry. I think that — I think they're dying to make a deal."
1129,2020-04-05,"Look, their country is in trouble. Their economics are shot. They're in — they've got a lot of bad things going. I think they'd like to make a deal. They can get it settled very quickly."
1130,2020-04-05,No nuclear weapons. No nuclear weapons.
1131,2020-04-05,They can't have nuclear weapons. It's very simple.
1132,2020-04-05,"Okay, let's let these folks get back to work. Is that okay? Thank you all very much."
1133,2020-04-05,"So, as we deploy our service members to combat both threats abroad, invisible enemy at home, earlier today I spoke to our nation's incredible warriors and military families. Spent a long time on the phone with thousands and thousands of families that were hooked in."
1134,2020-04-05,"In order to stop the spread of the virus, some of these families have delayed planned moves to their next duty station. And in other cases, military families are also waiting longer to welcome home their heroes from deployment. There's a tremendous burden to bear. And the families have been involved with us for so long, and they are incredible. Without the families, they couldn't be the great service members that they turned out to be, and they understand that."
1135,2020-04-05,"And I must say, protecting our military families is our top priority. So they understand what they're — what's happening with respect to the virus — and they understand it well. They've been fantastic."
1136,2020-04-05,"As Commander-in-Chief, I'm deeply grateful for our service members, their spouses, and their children, whose love, devotion, and sacrifice keeps America strong."
1137,2020-04-05,"To make, procure, and deliver crucial medical supplies to our doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, my administration is leveraging the might of American manufacturing, supply chains, and innovators across the industry and across every industry. And I just told you about Walmart and I could tell you about many more. Hanes is making protective gear and masks, and we're making tremendous amounts of product. There's never been anything like it."
1138,2020-04-05,"At the same time, I tell the governors, “Get it yourself, if you can, from your local companies and your local warehouses and factories. If you can do that, you should do that.”"
1139,2020-04-05,"Because of the actions that we've taken under the Defense Production Act, manufacturers and suppliers are sharing with FEMA and HHS their planned orders and allocations to states and to hospitals all over the region. This enables FEMA and HHS to work closely with states, local governments, and private sector to allocate critical resources to highly impacted areas."
1140,2020-04-05,"Working together, we're entirely focused on getting materials to the right place at the right time. So we want it to go directly to a hospital or directly to a certain state location, and ideally, not even hit the states' warehouses. If we can avoid the warehouses, it's even better because they go directly into a hospital."
1141,2020-04-05,"And one example of that is Ohio — the great state of Ohio. Senator Rob Portman called today and he asked for some help, and got us — did a tremendous job, along with Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, to facilitate a donation of 2.2 million gowns. 2.2 million gowns. Think of what that is: 2.2 million to the Strategic National Stockpile from Ohio-based Cardinal Health. Cardinal Health, we appreciate it. And they're making much more than that and different types of things."
1142,2020-04-05,We're profoundly grateful for their contribution to protect the lives and safety of our healthcare professionals. Cardinal has been working with us very well.
1143,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1144,2020-04-05,"I think the severity. I think also in looking at the way the contagion — it is so contagious. Nobody has ever seen anything like this, where large groups of people, all of a sudden, just by being in the presence of somebody, have it. The flu has never been like that. And there is — flu is contagious but nothing like we've ever seen here."
1145,2020-04-05,"Also, the violence of it. If it hits the right person — and you know what those stats are — if it hits the right person, that person is in deep trouble. And my friend was the right person."
1146,2020-04-05,"Yeah, well, not a turning point. No. Before that, I knew how — because I'm seeing numbers and I'm seeing statistics that are, you know, not exactly very good."
1147,2020-04-05,"So — but — but it hit him very hard. He's strong — a very strong kind of a guy. But he's older. He's heavier. And he's sort of central casting for what we're talking about, and it hit him very hard. I've never seen anything like it."
1148,2020-04-05,"Yeah, John?"
1149,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1150,2020-04-05,"Well, we're thinking about doing that. At the same time, we just — you know, to start these airlines and to start this whole thing over again is very tough, John. It's very tough. And you have them going, in some cases, from hotspot to hotspot. If you notice, they're usually hotspot to hotspot. Very few flights. New York to Miami."
1151,2020-04-05,"And — but we're thinking — we're certainly looking at it. But once you do that, you really are — you really are clamping down on an industry that is desperately needed."
1152,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to —"
1153,2020-04-05,Yeah. That is a calculation that we're looking at right now. We're looking at it very strongly.
1154,2020-04-05,Please.
1155,2020-04-05,Yeah. Sure.
1156,2020-04-05,"Because states are different. States are different. And I understand that the governor of Florida — great governor, Ron DeSantis — issued one today. And that's good. That's great. But there are some states that are different. There are some states that don't have much of a problem."
1157,2020-04-05,"There are some — well, they don't have the problem. They don't have thousands of people that are positive, or thousands of people that even think they might have it — or hundreds of people, in some cases."
1158,2020-04-05,"So you have to look — you have to look at states. You have to give a little bit of flexibility. I mean, if a state in the Midwest, or if Alaska, as an example, doesn't have a problem, it's awfully tough to say, “Close it down.” So we have to have a little bit of flexibility."
1159,2020-04-05,"Look, we're helping governors. We're really here to help governors. They're the frontline of attack, and that includes in purchasing, by the way. We're here and we're backing them up. And there's never been a backup like we've given them. We've given them billions of dollars' worth of things — medical supplies and ventilators; thousands and thousands of ventilators. We have thousands under construction right now. We have thousands ready to go in case they need it. There's never been anything like this."
1160,2020-04-05,"I mean, we've — they've done really — the people have done incredibly. We're building hospitals all over the country. We're building hospitals right now at a rate that has never even been contemplated before. They're mobile hospitals, but they're really not mobile. I mean, they're incredible structures. But we're building many hospitals: Louisiana, New Jersey, New York. We just finished a massive hospital complex. And we also have medical centers built in New York. I mean, we're building hospitals at the rate that this country has never done before. And hopefully it's all going to work out."
1161,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
1162,2020-04-05,"Well, we're looking at the whole thing, because we're getting into a position now where we want to do that. We have to do that. And so we're looking at the whole thing."
1163,2020-04-05,Yes.
1164,2020-04-05,And we may have — we may have some recommendations.
1165,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1166,2020-04-05,"It's like, from 1950, these oil prices. And that's when they had big dollars — big, beautiful dollars."
1167,2020-04-05,"Well, look, we have a great oil industry, and the oil industry is being ravaged. And, as you know, Russia — and I spoke to President Putin; we had a great call. Russia, Saudi Arabia — I spoke with the Crown Prince; we had a great call. But I think that they will work it out over the next few days. If you ask me, I think it's just — it's too simple not to be able to. They both know what they have to do. So I think — I have confidence in both that they'll be able to work it out."
1168,2020-04-05,"But it's — it has ravaged an industry worldwide, not here. I mean, worldwide, the oil industry has been ravaged. So there was a lot of oil production to start off with. And then, on top of it, it got hit with the virus, and business went down 35, 40 percent. So that business is a tough one. And, you know, they have ships all over the sea. I told you yesterday — all over the sea. Massive tankers that they're using for storage. They go out and they just sit there. There's no place to go. They have massive amounts."
1169,2020-04-05,"Now, gasoline is going to be 99 cents a gallon and less. You know that. That's already starting. It's popping up. Ninety-nine cents. So that's like giving a massive tax cut to people of our country. When we try and get the airlines going if — if fuel is costing much less, it helps with getting the airlines, which is always a tough business. Always has been a tough business."
1170,2020-04-05,"But with that being said, look, I want to get that industry back where it was. We were doing records in that industry also. We want to get it back to where it was."
1171,2020-04-05,"So I think that Saudi Arabia, Russia, they're negotiating. They're talking. And I think they'll come up with something."
1172,2020-04-05,"I'm going to meet with the oil companies on Friday. I'm going to meet with independent oil producers also on Friday or Saturday, maybe Sunday. But we're having a lot of meetings on it. I think I know what to do to solve it. But if — if they're unable to solve it, then I think I know what to do to solve it."
1173,2020-04-05,"We won't mention it now, but it's tough. I think I know what to do to solve it. We don't want to lose our great oil companies. You know, we're the number one producer of oil in the world. And a month ago, when you said that, it was great. Today, when you say it, it's not so meaningful."
1174,2020-04-05,"But I do believe there's a way that that can be solved or pretty well solved. And I'd rather not do that. I think that Russia and Saudi Arabia, at some point, are going to make a deal in the not-too-distant future because it's very bad for Russia. It's very bad for Saudi Arabia. It's very bad. I mean, it's bad for both, so I think they're going to make a deal."
1175,2020-04-05,"You know, the free market is a wonderful thing. It's amazing how it can work. But I think they're going to make a deal."
1176,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Yeah, please. In the back. Q Mr. President, a couple of questions. One for you, one for Mr. Wolf, if possible. Over 5 million immigrants in this country do pay taxes through their ID numbers, yet they will not receive any money in their stimulus package. And no undocumented immigrant will receive any aid from the government during this crisis. How do you suppose they survive during the COVID-19?"
1177,2020-04-05,"Well, you know, you're saying “undocumented,” meaning they came in illegally. And a lot of people would say we have a lot of citizens right now that won't be working. So, what are you going to do? It's a tough thing. It's a very terrible — it's a very sad question, I must be honest with you. But they came in illegally. And we have a lot of people that are citizens of our country that won't be able to have jobs."
1178,2020-04-05,"Now, I do think once we get rid of the virus, I think we're going to have a boom economy. I think it's going to go up rather quickly. Maybe very quickly. And maybe slowly. But it's going to go up, and it'll all come back. And I think it's actually going to come back stronger than what it was because of the stimulus."
1179,2020-04-05,"But it's a — it's a really sad situation, and we are working on it. I will tell you — I'm not going to give you a hard and fast answer because I just want to tell you, it's something I think about and it's something we're working on."
1180,2020-04-05,Please.
1181,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1182,2020-04-05,"And, Tony, how are they — how are they doing with the vaccines, Tony?"
1183,2020-04-05,"He doesn't need security. Everybody loves him. Besides, they'd be in big trouble if they ever attacked."
1184,2020-04-05,"You know, he was a great basketball player. Did anybody know that? He was a little on the short side for the NBA, but he was talented. And he — he won a game. I read the story. He won a game that was unwinnable against a great team. And his whole team said, “We can't beat this team.” And he went in and they won the game. Right? That was a couple of years ago, but —"
1185,2020-04-05,The head never changes. (Laughs.) The attitude never changes.
1186,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
1187,2020-04-05,He does. (Laughter.)
1188,2020-04-05,"Deborah — yes — yes, go ahead."
1189,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
1190,2020-04-05,He did. He spoke to me this morning.
1191,2020-04-05,"That, I don't know. He spoke to me this morning."
1192,2020-04-05,He knows what to do. Very good judgment.
1193,2020-04-05,Who can — who can?
1194,2020-04-05,"I didn't speak to him about it, but he did speak to me this morning. We talked about it. Please."
1195,2020-04-05,I don't know. I'd have to look at what he did.
1196,2020-04-05,I like it. I like it.
1197,2020-04-05,"Well, I think it's something we're discussing in terms of bonus or bonus pay. It doesn't have to be called “hazard pay.” It can be called —"
1198,2020-04-05,"Hey, look, I watch those people go into hospitals that — I know; I talked about one of them, right? But I watched them walk into those hospitals, and they walk in — men, women, young, middle aged, not so many older ones. And I watch — I watched them. They're almost like — and I think I can take the word “almost” out. They're like warriors. They're going in."
1199,2020-04-05,"People are cheering. Where there's a building across the street, the people are screaming, they're clapping, they're –they're like heroes."
1200,2020-04-05,"No, no, I will tell you, I think it's incredible."
1201,2020-04-05,"They're like — they're like warriors. They're like soldiers. And we're going to — we're going to be doing something for them. So whether it's bonus — because, you know, we're hopefully going to be over this relatively quickly. It's going to be vicious for a period of time, but hopefully we're going to be over this."
1202,2020-04-05,You have a lot of questions today. Look at you. Do you know this young lady behind you?
1203,2020-04-05,That's good. That's a good idea.
1204,2020-04-05,That's good for a marriage. Right.
1205,2020-04-05,I'll tell you. Mike?
1206,2020-04-05,"Okay. They took that up under the task force, and maybe, Mike, you want to say a few word about this — words about that?"
1207,2020-04-05,"John, I think this: I think it's a very fair question though, and it's something we're really going to look at because it doesn't seem fair. If you have it, you have a big advantage. And at certain income level you do."
1208,2020-04-05,"I think it's one of the greatest answers I've ever heard, because Mike was able to speak for five minutes and not even touch your question."
1209,2020-04-05,"So, I said — I said, that's what you call a great professional."
1210,2020-04-05,"But let me just tell you, you really are — it's really a fair question and it's something we're looking at."
1211,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I know."
1212,2020-04-05,We'll look.
1213,2020-04-05,Right.
1214,2020-04-05,They're a certain group. And it's a pretty big group. We're looking at it.
1215,2020-04-05,"Yeah. We are — I haven't been up there yet though, you know. The other people have been talking about it."
1216,2020-04-05,And they haven't spoken —
1217,2020-04-05,But they're thinking about it. They're talking about it.
1218,2020-04-05,"I know, but they're talking about it in 2020 election, too. And nobody has gotten to it. Nobody has talked about at all."
1219,2020-04-05,"I think we will, yeah. I think we're going to get to it. I think we're going to get to it. I don't think the other group will get to it. They haven't even spoken about it. And it's a big group of people."
1220,2020-04-05,"No, I'm not committing. But it's something we're going to look at."
1221,2020-04-05,I can't commit. I have to get approval from it. I have thing called “Congress.” But it's something we're going to look at. And we have been looking at it.
1222,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1223,2020-04-05,"If there is a phase four, but we're certainly looking at certain things. We want to help restaurants, entertainment. And we want to help — because it's jobs. Not that restaurants — it's jobs; tremendous amounts of jobs. So we're looking at that. We're looking at infrastructure."
1224,2020-04-05,"I mean, we — think of it: We will have spent $8 trillion. And, you know, it's way back. We're way pulled back. But we will have spent $8 trillion in the Middle East, and yet our roads are in bad shape; our bridges, our tunnels in bad shape."
1225,2020-04-05,"And we're going to be the talk of the world again soon. But we want 2 trillion. We will have spent in the Middle East — and all we got out of it was death and cost. But all we got out of it was death. Millions of people. You have to look at the other side too. Millions and millions of people killed. Our great soldiers — thousands killed; so many wounded, hurt. And yet, when we want to go and fix a road someplace, we want to do what we want to do in our country — no, it's time that we spend money on our country. That's what we're going to do."
1226,2020-04-05,"It's time that we start spending on our roads and our bridges and our schools, and all of the things that we're supposed to be spending on. And people are finally getting used to it. And you could look at all of what we've done in the Middle East, way back in so many different places — way back in other countries too, by the way."
1227,2020-04-05,"And I've gone to other countries that are very rich. I said, “I'm sorry, you're going to have to reimburse us for our costs.” They don't even want to — know what I'm talking about. It takes them 20 minutes to figure it out, because nobody has ever asked them to do that. And they're doing it. They're doing it. And they have no choice. They have to do it."
1228,2020-04-05,"So, it's time that we start spending on the USA."
1229,2020-04-05,"Okay, please."
1230,2020-04-05,"And many countries all over the world want to know whether or not they can use, especially, our new test that we — that was just developed by Abbott, which is almost instantaneous, which is going to be great."
1231,2020-04-05,"And remember this: We inherited — the word is we inherited bad tests. We really inherited bad tests. These are horrible tests. And it was broken. It was all broken. And we fixed it. And we're doing millions of tests. Sometimes, we send out a test and it's not used. In many cases, it wasn't used. But we worked with the states and the testing has been pretty amazing, especially considering the fact that we inherited a very broken system."
1232,2020-04-05,Jeff?
1233,2020-04-05,"I am looking at hotspots. I am looking where flights are going into hotspots. Some of those — some of those flights I didn't like from the beginning. But closing up every single flight on every single airline, that's a very — very, very rough decision, but we are thinking about hotspots, where you go from spot to spot, both hot. And we'll let you know fairly soon."
1234,2020-04-05,"A similar thing. We have trains going back and forth. And people don't think of trains, but we do a lot of transportation business. It's a very big decision to do that. And we're pretty late in the process from the standpoint that this is starting — you're going to start seeing — I think, over the next couple of weeks, you're going to start to see us hit a top and start coming down."
1235,2020-04-05,"So we'll make those decisions. Those are very, very — those are very, very big decisions, from the standpoint of — of the future of our country, in a way — in the future of our country."
1236,2020-04-05,"We have to get our country back, we have to start moving again, we have to start working again. Now, they're doing tests on airlines — very strong tests — for getting on, getting off. They're doing tests on trains — getting on, getting off. But when you start closing up entire transportation systems and then opening them up, that's a very tough thing to do."
1237,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
1238,2020-04-05,"Re-use. I love the sterilization of the mask. So, Ohio company — you can sterilize a — the N95. You can — you can sterilize that mask for up to 20 times. Think of that: up to 20 times. We're throwing them out and they're very expensive masks. They're throwing them out."
1239,2020-04-05,"And I kept saying — one of the first questions I asked to Dr. Fauci, I said, “Why aren't they sterilizing or cleaning the mask?” Because I didn't — you know, it wasn't my thing exactly when we first heard about this. Nobody else knew it either."
1240,2020-04-05,"And now we have a company and, I guess, a number of companies — one in Ohio, a great one — that makes equipment where you can sterilize a mask up to 20 times, which is fantastic."
1241,2020-04-05,Okay?
1242,2020-04-05,"I — I don't believe — look, this is a big things. A lot of people don't like it. Some people don't like it because you're taking it away from the medical professional. Some people don't like it for other reasons. I don't see where it hurts. And it doesn't have to be a mask; it can be a scarf. A scarf is highly recommended by the professionals."
1243,2020-04-05,"I don't see where it hurts. I think if — frankly, if people wanted to do it — we don't want to do anything that's going to take masks. You're talking about a tremendous amount of masks when you do that. We don't want to take them away from our medical professionals, but I certainly don't see it hurting."
1244,2020-04-05,"But what I do see people doing now is using scarves. And I think, in a certain way, depending on the fabric — I think, in a certain way, a scarf is better. It's actually better."
1245,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. You didn't — you didn't get — go ahead."
1246,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1247,2020-04-05,"Well, my biggest disappointment is that churches can't meet in a time of need. You know, this is really a great time for churches to be together, for people to get together on a Sunday or whenever — any day and meet. And yet, if you do that, if you do it close, you're really giving this invisible enemy a very big advantage."
1248,2020-04-05,"So, it's — it's the biggest — I think the single biggest disappointment is you can't — one of the reasons I said, “Wouldn't it be great just to — to pick a date?” As you know, I called it “aspirational” — an aspirational date would be Easter. And I will tell you, it's a — it's very, very disappointing. But again, you get too close, and if somebody is sick, you're going to probably catch it. So you have to be very careful."
1249,2020-04-05,Sleepy Joe.
1250,2020-04-05,Did he write the statement or did some PR person write it?
1251,2020-04-05,Good. For a change.
1252,2020-04-05,That's okay. Sure.
1253,2020-04-05,"Oh, absolutely. I'd like to —"
1254,2020-04-05,I'd like to speak to him. Sure. I'd like to — I'd be — he should be able to —
1255,2020-04-05,"I — I always found him to be a nice guy. I don't know him very well, frankly, but I think he's probably a nice guy. No, if he'd like to call, I'd absolutely take his call. Okay? You could tell him. All right?"
1256,2020-04-05,Well — and no ammunition. And maybe no ammunition.
1257,2020-04-05,We didn't do that. That turned out to be a false story. Now you're starting to go —
1258,2020-04-05,What? Are you working for CNN?
1259,2020-04-05,"I thought you were with Fox. Fox isn't so easy either, don't kid yourself."
1260,2020-04-05,"Look, John, let me tell you something. You know that's a false story."
1261,2020-04-05,What you just said is a false story.
1262,2020-04-05,This doctor knows it better than anybody.
1263,2020-04-05,"No, but you shouldn't be repeating a story that you know is false."
1264,2020-04-05,"All right, who — who's next? Please go ahead, in the back. You didn't get any."
1265,2020-04-05,It's very sad what's happening in Iran.
1266,2020-04-05,"Well, look, we have to talk to them. I think we could work out a deal with Iran very quickly. All they have to do is call. I just think that, you know, they're proud people, and the leadership is proud. They're proud like all of us. We're proud. You people are proud. They're having a hard time picking up the phone, or they're having a hard time setting up the meeting, but they could fix their country pretty easily."
1267,2020-04-05,"And we don't want hostility, but if they are hostile to us, they're going to regret it like they've never regretted anything before, as per today's statement. But all they have to do is call or have somebody call. You know, there are channels where we can deal very easily."
1268,2020-04-05,"Again, I think that John Kerry did a tremendous disservice. I think he violated the Logan Act, 100 percent. That's what I think. And I think it made it tough for them, because they were dealing with them for years. It was a terrible deal. All of that money — $150 billion, plus cash. Plus cash? Planeloads of cash for a deal that was no good. And it was short-term. Essentially, it was a short-term deal. Who makes a deal for that kind of money?"
1269,2020-04-05,"And $1.8 billion in cash. I don't even know what that would look like. That would be — this room would have to be filled up five times with hundred-dollar bills, okay? Who — who makes a deal like this? And then, on top of it, the deal is no good."
1270,2020-04-05,"All right, how about one or two more?"
1271,2020-04-05,About Mexican violence?
1272,2020-04-05,Oh.
1273,2020-04-05,"Well, it could be. It's another cost of — of not getting our country working. I mean, people are — now some people are getting along great. I've also had the oppo- — the exact opposite question. People — families are coming together. They're actually coming together. They haven't talked for a long time and, now, all of a sudden, they're talking again; they're loving each other."
1274,2020-04-05,"So I've heard that too, but I've also have heard domestic violence much — you know, at a higher level. And drug use, because of — in this case, they lose their jobs. They had a great job, they had a great life, they have a great family. All of a sudden, a husband is told that he doesn't have a job anymore and he's got no money. And that brings drugs into it, that brings suicide into it. It's a terrible thing. We have to get our country going again. We did the right thing."
1275,2020-04-05,"We had no choice. We did the right thing. Other countries tried to use the herd — or the herd mentality. It's just, you know, something that doesn't work. If you look at — I mean, just to say, I heard Sweden gave it a shot, and they went — they saw things that were really frightening and they went immediately to shutting down the country. We did the right thing and we did it early. We did it early. And we stopped other people from coming into our country early."
1276,2020-04-05,"But — but, no, that's a cost. That's a — I've been talking about that. People will say, “What are you talking about?” But you will have — you'll have that, you'll have domestic violence, you have violence, you'll have suicide, you'll have drug addiction. A lot of people are going to be lost."
1277,2020-04-05,"We want to get this open as soon as we can. I mean, I'll be the happiest person — so will you, everyone in this room — happy when we get the word that this is the time. And we have our common sense, and they'll give me a decision or they'll be making certain statements and I'll — I think I'll know how to interpret those statements very well. I'll be with Mike. I'll be with the task force. I'll be with a lot of very talented people, including the two people onstage with us."
1278,2020-04-05,"But, I look forward — that'll be a great day. That'll be a great day."
1279,2020-04-05,"All right. How about one more, please?"
1280,2020-04-05,Sure.
1281,2020-04-05,"Chad, please."
1282,2020-04-05,"While you're up, could you talk about how tight that southern border is right now?"
1283,2020-04-05,"But I am glad you asked that question because we want the farmers — they've had this for years. We want the farmers to be able to get the people that have been working those farms for years or we're not going to have farms. So they're going to come in and they're going to be given a certain pass. And we're going to check them very, very closely, especially over the next month."
1284,2020-04-05,"Because remember, after a month or so — I think once this passes, we're not going to have to be, hopefully, worried too much about the virus."
1285,2020-04-05,"But we want them to come in. We're not closing the border so that we can't get any of those people to come in. They've been there for years and years, and I've given the commitment to the farmers: They're going to continue to come. Or we're not going to have any farmers. Okay?"
1286,2020-04-05,Yeah. One more question.
1287,2020-04-05,"Who are you with, by the way?"
1288,2020-04-05,Boy. Amazing.
1289,2020-04-05,"Okay. Who else, please?"
1290,2020-04-05,"We're looking at the two ships. Yeah, we have —"
1291,2020-04-05,"We have Canada notified. A lot of Canadians, a lot of British on the ship. And they're coming to take the people that are on the ship back to their homeland. Canada is coming. The UK is coming. And we have a lot of — and we have Americans. We have some people that are quite sick and we're taking care of — that I'm speaking with the governor about that a lot."
1292,2020-04-05,"And it's a tough situation. It's a tough situation. You know, I — you can understand. You have people that are sick on those ships, and states don't want to take. They have enough problems right now. They don't want to take them, but we have to, from a humane standpoint. We don't have a choice. It's like, I don't want to do that, but we have to. People are dying."
1293,2020-04-05,"We're going to do something. We're going to do something. At a minimum, we're sending medical teams onboard the ships. We're taking the Canadians off and giving them to Canadian authorities. They're going to bring them back home. The same thing with the UK."
1294,2020-04-05,"But we have to help the people. They're — they're in big trouble no matter where — no matter where they're from. Happen to be Americans — largely Americans. But whether they were or not — I mean, they're dying. So we have to do something."
1295,2020-04-05,And — and the governor knows that too.
1296,2020-04-05,"Well, we're sending a lot of them home. Yeah, we're sending a lot of them home to their countries, but we'll be doing something and we'll be announcing it. You'll see what we're doing."
1297,2020-04-05,But we're also putting medical staff onto the ships so that we can — we have to take care of the people.
1298,2020-04-05,"No, you won't get chewed out. You know that."
1299,2020-04-05,"I had heard that. Now, I don't know. Do you know that answer, Mike?"
1300,2020-04-05,"It sounds like it. Yeah, I mean, we'll get —"
1301,2020-04-05,"We can get back — yeah, it's being — it's a process that they're working on. We'll get back to you as soon as we find out."
1302,2020-04-05,"All right, one more, please."
1303,2020-04-05,I did. I spoke to him. Of course.
1304,2020-04-05,He's great. He's a great guy and he's doing a wonderful job.
1305,2020-04-05,From Brazil. Spoke to him this morning.
1306,2020-04-05,"And just a very complimentary call. He's working very hard. He's got a problem with a virus — got a big problem. And he's — we talked about it today at length. We had a call this morning. And Brazil is shut down, as you know. They weren't going to shut it down, but they had to. So Brazil is shut down."
1307,2020-04-05,The world is shut down. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. The entire world is shut down.
1308,2020-04-05,"You go from having the most powerful economy in the world, and from other countries that are doing well, to being everything is shut down. It's very sad, but we're going to get it going. And we're going to be stronger than ever. I really believe that. We're going to be stronger. We're going to have a big bounce — a very big bounce when this has gone."
1309,2020-04-05,"And I just want to thank the American people. I want to thank these great professionals. And I want to thank the media, because really, for the most part, that media has been very fair."
1310,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, everybody."
1311,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Appreciate everybody being here. Beautiful day in the Rose Garden. Tremendous distance between chairs. Social distancing. You practice it very well. We appreciate it. That's great.
1312,2020-04-05,I want to start today by highlighting several critical developments on both the testing and treatment that will help us win our war against the coronavirus.
1313,2020-04-05,"On Friday, the FDA authorized a new test developed by Abbott Labs that delivers lightning-fast results in as little as five minutes. That's a whole new ballgame. I want to thank Abbott Labs for the incredible work they've done. They've been working around the clock. Normally, this approval process from the FDA would take 10 months, and even longer, but we did it in four weeks. Abbott has stated that they will begin delivering 50,000 tests each day, starting this week."
1314,2020-04-05,"And as you know, even before this development, we've been doing more test — tests than any other country anywhere in the world. It's one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries, because we've been testing. It's also one of the reasons that we're just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate, because we've been doing more testing. So we have bigger numbers to look at."
1315,2020-04-05,"I want to also thank General Semonite, of the Army Corps of Engineers, and General Polowczyk, who's here with us, who's going to say a few words in a little while. What the Army Corps of Engineers did, along with FEMA, in New York was incredible. They built 2,900 beds' worth of hospital. An incredible hospital in the Javits Center, which I know well. And I just want to say that was unreal. They did it in less than four days. People have never seen anything like that. And it's an incredible, complex, top-of-the-line hospital. They did it so quickly. Everyone is trying to figure out how they did it, including me — and I was a good builder. But they did it very quickly, Mike. So we're very — we're very happy."
1316,2020-04-05,"So I want to thank Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA — the incredible job they have done."
1317,2020-04-05,"Now they're moving to other locations throughout the country where they already have people building hospitals. We're doing them in Louisiana and New Jersey — many, many other places. But these are incredible men and women, and they worked around the clock."
1318,2020-04-05,"And the people of New York are very happy. Governor Cuomo expressed his thanks, which we appreciate. But these are — I mean, there's nobody could have done a job like that. Most people have never seen anything like it."
1319,2020-04-05,"The deployment of rapid testing will vastly accelerate our ability to monitor, track, contain, and ultimately defeat the virus. We will defeat the virus. It will also allow us to test doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers immediately and enable us to act quickly and aggressively to shut down the spread of the virus — so important — in critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes. And we will ensure that we can give cities and states the best information to guide local decision makers and making."
1320,2020-04-05,"I want to point out that the hydroxychloroquine is being administered to 1,100 patients — people in New York — along with the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin. And it's very early yet; it's only — it started two days ago. But we will see what happens."
1321,2020-04-05,"I want to thank Stephen Hahn, who's a great doctor — left one of the best jobs in our country running an incredible Hospital in Texas. And he's the head of the FDA. And Stephen got approval for that so fast. Let's see how it works. It may, it may not. But we may have some incredible results. We're going to know soon. So it's tested — it's being tested on 1,100 people in New York."
1322,2020-04-05,"The FDA is also allowing the emergency use of a blood-related therapy called convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment for seriously ill patients. This treatment involves taking blood plasma from patients who have already recovered from the virus. So they've recovered; they're strong. Something was good in them that worked. And so we take the plasma from those people that have recovered so well — meaning, their plasma is rich in antibodies against the virus — and transfusing it into six [six] patients — sick patients, very — very, very powerfully."
1323,2020-04-05,"So, sick patients will be transfused with the blood taken to boost their immune system. We'll see what happens. And we're having some early results that are good, but we will see. And that's going, I think, very rapidly. Again, we got approvals in, really, very quick time."
1324,2020-04-05,"We're also looking at an approval for the sterilization of masks. I kept saying to myself — I'd see some of the masks are very complex. We're delivering millions, by the way. Millions. But I kept saying, “Why aren't they able to use that mask a second, third, fourth time?”"
1325,2020-04-05,"And Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, called me. They have a company that is in the final process of getting approval for the sterilization of masks, and in some cases, depending on the mask — some of these masks are very, very strong, very powerful, very strong material — they're able to sterilize the mask up to 20 times. So that's, I guess, like getting 20 masks. And so we worked on that. As soon as I heard from Mike today, I got involved, and the FDA is now involved. And we're trying to get a fast approval for the sterilization of masks. That would be a tremendous difference. That would be really helpful."
1326,2020-04-05,"While much of the research has to be done — we have a lot of research left to do, obviously — this treatment on plasma has shown promising results in other countries. We're in communication with other countries, and very strong communications. And they're very reliant on us in just about all cases. We have the greatest people in the world. They're very, very anxious to find out how we're doing on our different things, whether it's a cure or whether it's really anything having to do with getting people better. We have some interesting things will be announced, I think over the next few weeks, but we'll see what happens. They're being tested right now."
1327,2020-04-05,"The vaccines are moving along very rapidly. The vaccines are an answer, but I'd like to see if we could do something therapeutically so that we could take care of the people that are already sick. And we're working on that at a level that people would be amazed. These are incredible people. They don't stop."
1328,2020-04-05,"This method also has been used for more than a century — and that's the blood-related therapy — you know, more than a century to fight off infectious diseases. So it's not unusual. Our level of complexity has changed, but it's a concept that's been used for a long time, including during the Spanish Flu epidemic. And that was really a pandemic of proportions like, frankly, nobody has seen until what we're facing now. That was in 1918. You know what the result of that was; probably from 75 to 100 million people were killed."
1329,2020-04-05,"And also, other viruses, like the one in this outbreak — this is a very tough one. This is a tough one because it spreads so quickly, like nothing we've seen. It spreads so easily, so quickly."
1330,2020-04-05,"We're unleashing every tool in our nation's vast arsenal — economic, medal [sic] — medical. If you look, medical, and scientific, military. Homeland Security is working very, very hard with all of them in order to vanquish the virus."
1331,2020-04-05,"As you know, every level of government — state, local, and federal — is working nonstop to obtain more personal protective equipment for frontline workers. We're delivering vast orders of this material. I'm going to ask a couple of the people here to join me that both make it and deliver it."
1332,2020-04-05,"Joining us today are the leaders of America's largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, including McKesson, Cardinal Health, Henry Schein, Owens &amp; Minor, Medline, FedEx, and UPS. We just concluded a very productive meeting about ways to keep our supply chains and delivery systems moving at top speed."
1333,2020-04-05,"And maybe I'd like to just ask for a couple of minutes for Mike Kaufmann to come up, and maybe Ed Pesicka. Mike is with Cardinal and Ed is Owen &amp; Minor."
1334,2020-04-05,"But I — and I appreciate. And if anybody else has anything, please come up. But if you could come up, Mike, for a second and, Ed, for a second. Just, if you could maybe say what you told me before when we had the meeting. Thank you."
1335,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
1336,2020-04-05,Appreciate it. Please.
1337,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
1338,2020-04-05,"And I bring that up because when we discussed, back in a room — we were in a conference room — a very nice one, actually; it's called the Cabinet Room — that statement was made that they've been delivering for years, 10- to 20,000 masks. Okay, it's a New York hospital. Very — it's packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20, to 300,000? 10- to 20,000 masks to 300,000?"
1339,2020-04-05,"Even though this is different, something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going? Are they going out the back door? How do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So, somebody should probably look into that, because I just don't see, from a practical standpoint, how that's possible to go from that to that. And we have that happening in numerous places — not to that extent; that was the highest number I've heard. That's the highest number you've seen, I would imagine, right?"
1340,2020-04-05,"But this man makes them and delivers them to a lot of hospitals. He knows the system better than anybody. And I think you were more surprised than I was when you saw that number. So thank you very much. I hope I didn't get any of your clients in trouble, but it could be that they are in trouble. So they have to look at that in New York."
1341,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Great job you're doing.
1342,2020-04-05,Please. Thank you very much.
1343,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Great job. Please.
1344,2020-04-05,Great job. Yeah.
1345,2020-04-05,Fantastic job.
1346,2020-04-05,"Anybody else, if you want? Yes, please. You're doing such a great job, we have to —"
1347,2020-04-05,— have everybody if they want.
1348,2020-04-05,Thank you. Thank you.
1349,2020-04-05,"So thank you all very much and for the great job you're doing. It's really incredible, frankly. Many of the states are stocked up. Some of them don't admit it, but they have — we have sent just so much — so many things to them and — including ventilators."
1350,2020-04-05,"You know, there's a question as to hoarding of ventilators. Some hospitals and independent hospitals — and some hospital chains, as we call them — they are holding ventilators; they don't want to let them up. We need them for certain areas where there's big problems. We can't hold them if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road."
1351,2020-04-05,"So we've delivered a lot, and this group has been really fantastic. We want to thank you. And UPS and FedEx, in particular, you've gone absolutely out of your way, so we appreciate everything you've done and delivered."
1352,2020-04-05,The federal government continues to mobilize every resource to make sure our frontline doctors and nurses have the equipment needed to save American lives.
1353,2020-04-05,"Yesterday, I visited Naval Station Norfolk as the USNS Comfort departed from New York three weeks ahead of schedule, fully loaded with 12 operating rooms, 1,000 hospital beds, and hundreds of the best doctors, nurses, and medical professionals anywhere in the United States Navy — anywhere, frankly, in the United States. It was an incredible thing to see. Mostly you saw that on television as it was leaving. It left literally three weeks early. It was under maintenance, and they got the maintenance done very quickly. They work round the clock as many of the people have. And it was a great sight."
1354,2020-04-05,"Additionally, two of the country's largest health insurers, Humana and Cigna, are announcing that they will waive co-pays — which is a big deal for anybody that understands insurance; they don't waive co-pays too easily, but we've asked them to do it and they've done it — coinsurance and deductibles for the coronavirus treatments to help ease the financial burden on American families during this pandemic. So they're waiving co -pays, coinsurance, and deductibles. Nobody has — I don't think anyone has heard of that one. Have you heard of that one before? I haven't heard. I want to thank them. Great companies."
1355,2020-04-05,"Today I spoke with Wolfgang Puck. Wolfgang Puck is a great restauranteur, as you know, as is Jean-Georges and Thomas Keller and Daniel Boulud, and other leaders in the restaurant business, which has been probably one of the hardest-hit industries. I've directed my staff to use any and all authority available to give restaurants, bars, clubs incentives to stay open. You're going to lose all these restaurants and they're not going to make it back. They have to get going."
1356,2020-04-05,"So what I'm doing is I'm going to tell Secretary Mnuchin and also our great Secretary of Labor, who you know very well, to immediately start looking into the restoring of the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations that set the restaurant business back a lot when it was done originally, and then done not so long ago."
1357,2020-04-05,"And we're going to go to deductibility so that companies can send people to restaurants. I think it'll have a tremendous impact and maybe keep them open. I mean, don't forget, some are closing right now, despite the fact that they could be open in the not-too-distant future, and we expect that. But there are some that aren't going to be able to get open, and we want to make sure they do."
1358,2020-04-05,So we're going to look at the restoration — restoring the deductibility of meals and entertainment costs for corporations so that corporations can send people to restaurants and take a deduction on it like they did in the old days. That was when restaurants were doing really well.
1359,2020-04-05,"The financial relief bill I signed on Friday provided historic relief for American workers and small businesses, and it includes $350 billion in job restoration and retention. So if you look at job retention loans for small businesses, that's a big deal, with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying the worker. So it's $350 billion — job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying workers. I mean, how about that?"
1360,2020-04-05,"Three hundred billion dollars in direct cash payments are being sent to every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year; $3,400 for the typical family of four. So they'll be getting a check for $3,400 for the typical family of four."
1361,2020-04-05,"Approximately $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. Under this plan, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months. The bill provides for these unemployment checks to be delivered through the existing state unemployment systems, not us. State."
1362,2020-04-05,"And I was opposed to this method because many of the states have very antiquated computer systems that are 45 years old, and they're not prepared to handle this kind of distribution, this kind of money coming in so quickly. They're not set up for that. And I didn't want to do it but our opponents wanted it, so we did it. And if they don't get their money fast, I'm going to ask that we convene the federal government — that we come back to Congress and we'll do something where we take care of it, because we can take care of it very easily and quickly — and I said that."
1363,2020-04-05,"But a lot of these systems, they're so old and so antiquated at the state level that they're going to — they have the money, and they're going to get the money very quickly, but they're not going to be able to distribute it. So remember what I said, and we will, if we have to, call Congress back or find some other way of delivery of the money."
1364,2020-04-05,"Throughout this great national struggle, the American people have embodied the unrivaled patriotism and willpower that has led America to conquer every challenge — every single one in our nation's history. More than 90 percent of Americans say they're staying home as much as possible, putting their lives, their careers, their educations, and their dreams on hold out of devotion to their fellow citizens and to their country. Social distancing: That's the way you win."
1365,2020-04-05,"These shared sacrifices are pulling our nation together like never before. Family bonds are strengthening. Neighbors are looking after neighbors. It's incredible. I'm seeing, you're seeing, everybody is seeing what's happening. Communities are rallying for the cause, and all divisions are fading away."
1366,2020-04-05,"The Americans of every background are uniting to help our nation in this hour of need. It's up to 151 countries. So when we say “our nation” — our nation and the world, when you think. Think of it: 151 countries. Somebody said to me today that wasn't in this particular world — they didn't know that we had that many countries. A hundred and fifty-one countries. That's something."
1367,2020-04-05,"And some are struggling at a level that nobody would have believed possible. If you look at Italy, if you look at — France is having big problems. Spain is having incredible problems. Something we did very well is, when we stopped the inflow from China at a very early level, that was a good thing to do, a great thing to do. We would have had thousands and thousands of more deaths. And we also stopped the inflow from Europe at a very early level. But those things were very important, especially the initial one, because we had never done anything like it, where we closed our borders to a country like that."
1368,2020-04-05,"The modeling put together by Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci and our other top healthcare ex- — I mean, we have — and these people are amazing — the healthcare experts who, in this country, are the best in the world. They demonstrate that the mitigation measures we are putting in place may significantly reduce the number of new infections and, ultimately, the number of fatalities."
1369,2020-04-05,"I want the American people to know that your selfless, inspiring, and valiant efforts are saving countless lives. You're making the difference. The modeling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks. So, I'll say it again: The peak, the highest point of death rates — remember this — is likely to hit in two weeks. Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all."
1370,2020-04-05,"Therefore, the next two weeks, and during this period, it's very important that everyone strongly follow the guidelines. Have to follow the guidelines that our great Vice President holds up a lot. He's holding that up a lot. He believes in it so strongly. The better you do, the faster this whole nightmare will end."
1371,2020-04-05,"Therefore, we will be extending our guidelines to April 30th to slow the spread. On Tuesday, we will be finalizing these plans and providing a summary of our findings, supporting data, and strategy to the American people. So we'll be having lots of meetings in between, but we'll be having a very important statement made on Tuesday — probably Tuesday evening — on all of the findings, all of the data, and the reasons we're doing things the way we're doing them."
1372,2020-04-05,"We can expect that, by June 1st, we will be well on our way to recovery. We think, by June 1st, a lot of great things will be happening."
1373,2020-04-05,"I want every citizen in our country to take heart and confidence in the fact that we have the best medical minds in the world tackling this disease. We have the best science, the best researchers, and the best talent anywhere working night and day to protect your family and loved ones and to overcome this pandemic."
1374,2020-04-05,"With the grace of God, we are rising to the occasion. We are proving that no darkness can overshadow the eternal light of American courage. We will win. And when we do, we will rebound with astonishing force and speed. We will be stronger than ever, and we will have learned so much, where something like this can never hurt us to the extent it has — and the world — again."
1375,2020-04-05,"In our present crisis, the strength of our people is our single most important asset, and together we will defeat this invisible curse — this is invisible enemy — and rise to incredible new heights."
1376,2020-04-05,So I just want to thank you all for being here. And we'll take some questions if you'd like.
1377,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Kelly."
1378,2020-04-05,"No, I want the people of New York to check — Governor Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio — that when a hospital that's getting 10,000 masks goes to 300,000 masks during the same period — and that's a rapid period — I would like them to check that. Because I hear stories like that all the time. You know, we're develop- — we're delivering millions and millions of different products and all we do is hear that, “Can you get some more?” But when you hear that — and I heard that from one of the great companies of the world at doing this — it's a client. And they're going from — you heard it — 10,000, 20,000, tops, to 300,000. And that's a hospital that's always full."
1379,2020-04-05,"So I think people should check that because there's something going on, whether — it's not — I don't think it's hoarding; I think it's maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out. Check it out."
1380,2020-04-05,I don't know. I don't know. I think that's for other people to figure out. But you don't go from numbers like that.
1381,2020-04-05,"Now, other equipment likewise, because we're delivering a lot of ventilators, we're deve- — and we're building. By the way, we're building and buying, and we have a lot of ventilators that we're going to be sending out very soon. We also have, right now, in the stockpile, almost 10,000 ventilators that we have to hold in case of emergency."
1382,2020-04-05,"We don't want them going out and then Louisiana has a tremendous problem, which we now know they do. You know, all of a sudden, it came very quickly. It came — I mean, Louisiana was doing so fantastically well. Then, all of a sudden, there was a big rash of cases."
1383,2020-04-05,"So, we have to be prepared to move the ventilators. They're very important pieces of equipment. They're very expensive and they're very complex. They're very — it's like building a car. You know, these are expensive, complicated — very complicated pieces of equipment. So we now have 10,000."
1384,2020-04-05,"And we inherited a system which was broken. Just like — I'll never forget the day when a general came and said, “Sir” — my first week in office — “we have no ammunition.” That was in the military. We've now rebuilt our military stronger than it's ever been. And we have so much ammunition. You wouldn't believe it, how much ammunition we have."
1385,2020-04-05,"But the same thing here. We had — we had a stockpile that was deficient. We had testing that was no good. We had a testing situation that just wasn't right. It was okay for very small cases, but it was obsolete and it was broken, and it was only good for a very small situation."
1386,2020-04-05,"But what I'd like to do is I'd like to ask Dr. Fauci to come forward and discuss the number, because I think the number — I think the number is going to be a very different number than the numbers that you talked about."
1387,2020-04-05,"Please, Doctor, you might talk about that."
1388,2020-04-05,"Deborah, please. Would you — can you explain the 2.2 million, if we did nothing?"
1389,2020-04-05,Because a lot of people would like to know that.
1390,2020-04-05,"I just want to reiterate, because a lot of people have been asking, “Well, what would have happened if we did nothing? Did nothing — we just rode it out.” And I've been asking that question to Tony and Deborah, and they've been talking to me about it for a long time. Other people have been asking that question. And I think we got our most accurate study today, or certainly most comprehensive."
1391,2020-04-05,"Think of the number: 2.2 — potentially 2.2 million people if we did nothing. If we didn't do the distancing, if we didn't do all of the things that we're doing. And when you hear those numbers, you start to realize that with the kind of work we went through last week, with the $2.2 trillion, it no longer sounds like a lot, right?"
1392,2020-04-05,"So you're talking about — when I heard the number today — first time I've heard that number, because I've been asking the same question that some people have been asking — I felt even better about what we did last week with the $2.2 trillion, because you're talking about a potential of up to 2.2 million. And some people said it could even be higher than that. So you're talking about 2.2. million deaths — 2.2 million people from this."
1393,2020-04-05,"And so, if we can hold that down, as we're saying, to 100,000 — that's a horrible number — maybe even less, but to 100,000; so we have between 100- and 200,000 — we all, together, have done a very good job. But 2.2, up to 2.2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that. I'm feeling very good about what we did last week."
1394,2020-04-05,"Yes, please. Go ahead, please."
1395,2020-04-05,No.
1396,2020-04-05,"It was just an aspiration. We actually will be hitting, potentially — and this was with our meeting before — on Easter, we probably — they — well, that could be a peak. That could be a peak period. That could be the peak. Sadly to say, that could be the peak number of deaths before it starts coming down."
1397,2020-04-05,"No, that was aspirational. We had a — an aspiration of Easter. But when you hear these kind of numbers and you hear the potential travesty, we don't want to do anything where — you know, we don't want to have a spike up. We don't want to do it soon, and then all of a sudden you go down — you're coming down and then you start going up again. Because we discussed that can happen, and we don't want that to happen. We've gone through too much."
1398,2020-04-05,"So that was an aspirational number. I didn't say “Easter.” I said, “It would be a great thing, if we could do it by Easter.” And we know much more now that we knew two, three weeks ago. Easter should be the peak number, and it should start coming down, and hopefully very substantially from that point."
1399,2020-04-05,Okay? Thank you.
1400,2020-04-05,Please. OAN.
1401,2020-04-05,Yes.
1402,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know. I know that — boy, that's a nice question. Thank you very much."
1403,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I don't want high approval ratings for this. I wish we could have our old life back. We had the greatest economy that we've ever had, and we didn't have death. We didn't have this. We didn't have this horrible scourge, this plague — you can call it whatever you want. The virus. But we're working very hard. That's all I know."
1404,2020-04-05,"You know, I see things — I see numbers. They don't matter to me. What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible."
1405,2020-04-05,"When you hear that 2.2 million people could have died if we didn't go through all of this, and now the number will be, you know, a much lower number. Hopefully, it's going to be the numbers that we're talking about."
1406,2020-04-05,"But — so I appreciate it very much. But, you know, what I want is I want our life back again. I want our country back. I want the world back. I want the world to get rid of this."
1407,2020-04-05,"This — again, 151 countries. And we're going to do it. We're going to have a great victory. We're going to have a great victory."
1408,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
1409,2020-04-05,"Well, that's what they said. I told you what they're going to take."
1410,2020-04-05,"Co-pays in particular, that's a big deal. Insurance companies don't do that, and I appreciate it. Humana and Cigna, they should be getting a lot of credit for that."
1411,2020-04-05,"I don't know. Well, those two are getting a lot of credit right now for it. And they should, because it's something that — it's a lot of money they're waiving. And so we thank them."
1412,2020-04-05,Will there be other companies? I wouldn't be surprised. There's great —
1413,2020-04-05,"There's great spirit. I'll tell you what — yeah, I'd love to have them do it. Let them waive those co-pays. There's a great spirit in this country right now."
1414,2020-04-05,"I mean, I know insurance companies better than anybody. They just don't do that. But now there's a spirit like I have not seen. I have never seen anything like it."
1415,2020-04-05,"I mean, even the media is much more fair. I wouldn't say all of it, but that's okay. They should be fair because they should want this to end. This is — this is about death."
1416,2020-04-05,So I want to thank Cigna and Humana. Thank you.
1417,2020-04-05,"They haven't asked for reimbursement, so I assume they're not. They said they're going to waive them. Waiving them doesn't mean we're going to waive them and get reimbursed. No."
1418,2020-04-05,"Well, they're going to be getting the money. I will tell you, I think landlords are going to take it easy. We may put out a statement on that. I think a lot of people that are owed money are going to take it easy. They don't, sort of, have a choice. But a lot of concessions are made, just like the insurance companies. A lot of concessions are being made that wouldn't have even been thought of three weeks ago. Not even thought of."
1419,2020-04-05,"So, a lot of really positive things are happening."
1420,2020-04-05,"Please, behind you."
1421,2020-04-05,"I didn't do that at all. Read the statement. Read the statement. Read what I said. I said we're going to look into “possibly quarantine.” I didn't say we're “going to quarantine.” I looked at it as a possibility, because a lot of our professionals suggested quarantine. I said we're going to look at it. We then looked at it. You see?"
1422,2020-04-05,"Who are you with? Bloomberg, right? I can't imagine that."
1423,2020-04-05,"Let me just tell you, I didn't threaten it. I don't go around threatening. What happened is, people — professionals, very good professionals — love the idea of doing that, because that's sort of the ultimate in distancing. You can't do — they didn't want New Yorkers, where they're having a problem, necessarily going down to Florida where they have less of a problem."
1424,2020-04-05,"So the concept of quarantine was thrown out to me. Really, would love to do it — they would love to do it. And I thought it was too much to do, because the people are doing a great job with it. Also, it's very hard to enforce."
1425,2020-04-05,"Okay, please."
1426,2020-04-05,"No, I think we made people aware to stay in your houses and do good. Now we did an advisory. It's a strong advisor. The governors are running the advisory — the three governors: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut. And I think we did a great thing."
1427,2020-04-05,"But all I did yesterday, as you know, and you can see it. You can read it. You can read. And you can see very simply that I said that, “We are looking into it.” And then before the end of the evening, substantially, we decided to go with the advisory, which frankly, I liked better from the beginning."
1428,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1429,2020-04-05,I didn't say that.
1430,2020-04-05,I didn't say that.
1431,2020-04-05,I didn't say — come on. Come on.
1432,2020-04-05,"You know, why don't — why don't you people act — let me ask you: Why don't you act —"
1433,2020-04-05,Why don't you act in a little more positive? It's always trying to “get you.”
1434,2020-04-05,“Get you. Get you.” And you know what? That's why nobody trusts the media anymore. That's why people —
1435,2020-04-05,"Excuse me. You didn't hear me. That's why you used to work for the Times and now you work for somebody else. Look, let me tell you something: Be nice. Don't be threatening."
1436,2020-04-05,Don't be threating. Be nice.
1437,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1438,2020-04-05,It's not going to impact.
1439,2020-04-05,"We're producing tremendous numbers of ventilators. We're doing a great job on it. Mike Pence, our Vice President, has headed up the task force, which has been incredible, the job they've done. We have everybody in the White House working on it. We have — everybody in the country is working on this in one way or the other."
1440,2020-04-05,"The fact is, we've done a great job of delivering. You've seen the biggest people in the business — I mean, there's nobody even close to this group of people. We had a meeting at 3 o'clock. It lasted for a long time. It was a great meeting with the generals and with everybody else. And they have done a fantastic job."
1441,2020-04-05,"I'm just saying this: If they're holding — let me give you one example. We sent thousands of generators to New York. They were put into a warehouse — a New York warehouse — that happened to be located, interestingly, in Edison, New Jersey. They were given to New York, and we then went to other places, also giving thousands of ventilators. The people in New York never distributed the generators. We said, “Why didn't you distribute them?” Now, you have to understand, they have New York people working in those warehouses. I knew they had them. So we said, “Why didn't you distribute them?” I'm — I hope they've distributed them now. But maybe they didn't need them so badly."
1442,2020-04-05,"But just so you know, we're all — you, me, everybody — we're all on the same team. You know, when — when journalists get up — and you're a journalist, a fine journalist —"
1443,2020-04-05,— when journalists get up and ask questions that are so threatening — we're all on the same team.
1444,2020-04-05,"Take a look at my interview. What I want to do is, if there is something wrong, we have to get to the bottom of it. When I hear facemasks go from 10,000 to 300,000, and they constantly need more, and the biggest man in the business is, like, shocked — he knows all about the virus, by the way; he's not surprised by that. He knows all about it. He shouldn't be surprised. He should say, “Well, that's standard,” because this is, really, a very tough disease. This is, really, a very tough virus to handle."
1445,2020-04-05,"Okay. Please, go ahead."
1446,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1447,2020-04-05,That's — that's enough. Thank you very much.
1448,2020-04-05,Please. Please.
1449,2020-04-05,That's enough.
1450,2020-04-05,"That's enough. That's not fair to your other reporters. It's not fair. You had a long time, a long question."
1451,2020-04-05,"It's — if we have time, I'll get back to you for your second question. Is that okay?"
1452,2020-04-05,All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.
1453,2020-04-05,"Well, we don't know that, but we think the peak will hit."
1454,2020-04-05,"Right, that is —"
1455,2020-04-05,Our two doctors here.
1456,2020-04-05,"Well, I can. I think I'll ask Doctor and Doctor. Maybe you could both come up and give your opinion on that, because that's really —"
1457,2020-04-05,Okay. Please.
1458,2020-04-05,Thank you.
1459,2020-04-05,Just — just to finish with —
1460,2020-04-05,"So — so what both were saying, and what Dr. Fauci just brought up, we don't want to do well and then end a little bit early and have it start going up again, because that would be a disaster."
1461,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
1462,2020-04-05,Yes.
1463,2020-04-05,Yes.
1464,2020-04-05,"Yes, we are."
1465,2020-04-05,"In fact, I met last night with our people. We're sending them a lot of different things that we're not needing, because we're obviously in need of a lot also. And we're also helping them monetarily. We are helping Italy a lot. We're working very closely with Italy. And we're working closely with Spain too, which is really hit hard."
1466,2020-04-05,"And we're — we're working with everybody. I spoke with Angela Merkel the other day; Germany is hit hard. Their mortality rate is different, I think, because they do more testing. But their mortality rate is much different. Italy's mortality rate is very high, so is Spain. But we're working very closely with them."
1467,2020-04-05,"Yes, we had a big meeting on it last night."
1468,2020-04-05,"Admiral Giroir, would you please come up and just talk a little bit about the tremendous success that's been made on testing from where we started? Thank you."
1469,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Admiral, very much."
1470,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please go ahead."
1471,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't have to tell you because those companies have come into line. They're doing a great job. They're working very hard 24 hours, around the clock."
1472,2020-04-05,"So I don't want to give their names now because they are — they've been great. They've come into line. And, by the way, General Motors is doing a fantastic job. I don't think we have to worry about General Motors now. They've really — they've really done a job."
1473,2020-04-05,"And what the Admiral said also — I think we can add this, Admiral: The reason we show more cases than anybody else in the world is we're doing more testing than anybody else in the world. So we have more cases because we're doing far more testing than anybody in the world."
1474,2020-04-05,"And remember, we started with a system that was broken. For many years, it was broken. And I'm not blaming the last administration. I'm saying other administrations. And our pipeline had very little in it. Just like we had no ammunition, we had very little medical; we had very little in our pipeline. Now we have ammunition — more than hopefully we'll ever need. And we also have a pipeline that's packed."
1475,2020-04-05,"And now we have those 10,000 ventilators that we can use because you need some quickly. I mean, this goes quickly from place to place. I'd love to give them all out right now. But we need them quickly. I don't want to give them out and then we have to take them back and move them someplace else. So we're very much prepared."
1476,2020-04-05,Please.
1477,2020-04-05,"Well, I think you're going to find that most — almost all states — look, I was on the call yesterday with the governors, and they were happy with the job we're doing. And I'll tell you what: If you had a different administration, they would not have been happy. These are people that speak their mind. They were happy. It was falsely reported by a couple of people that, “Oh, gee, they weren't” — they were happy. They were thrilled."
1478,2020-04-05,"Florida has been taken care of and Michigan has been taken care of — a very important state. To me, it's very important because I'm so proud of what we've done, bringing car companies back into Michigan. And we're now dealing with the governor, and I think, Mike, I can say that a lot of good things are happening in Michigan. Massachusetts — we're dealing with the governor very strongly and we're trying to get things to Massachusetts as rapidly as possible."
1479,2020-04-05,"Well, Florida — look, they're very aggressive in trying to get things, and they're doing a very good job. But I think — I think I can say all of the governors are very committed. We're very committed. We're working together. And we're getting things out at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We can — you can speak to FedEx, you can speak to UPS. You can speak — they've never done anything like this, what they're doing right now. And nobody in the world has been able to match what these great companies have been able to do."
1480,2020-04-05,"If we left that to government, it would have been a tough thing. We have mobilized private enterprise. We have mobilized the greatest companies in the world. And what's happening is incredible, and that includes Abbott, where Abbott comes out and, all of a sudden, out of nowhere comes up with this incredible test that simplifies everything and makes it so easy."
1481,2020-04-05,"So I think you're going to find most states are very happy. I'm dealing with the Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards. He's a Democrat — if that's what you're getting at. But I'm dealing with him very successfully. I think he's very happy. I think he's actually amazed at what he's been able to get. In fact, we were even forward thinking. I suggested we send additional ventilators and other things."
1482,2020-04-05,"We're building a hospital in Louisiana, very importantly. We're building hospitals in New Jersey. Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a terrific guy and, frankly, he wants — you know, he's got a pretty hot spot right there, right next to New York. And we're doing hospitals. We're doing ventilators. We're getting a lot to Governor Murphy; that's New Jersey."
1483,2020-04-05,"Last night, I spoke to the governor of — last night, I spoke to the governor of Connecticut. We had a great talk with him. We are really doing a job."
1484,2020-04-05,"Look, Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, he's been — he's been terrific. We sent him a boat way ahead of schedule — the ship — way ahead of schedule — a hospital ship, the Mercy, with 1,000 beds, operating rooms. And it's — it's been in L.A. for three days already."
1485,2020-04-05,"So I think they're really happy. And when you think about it, in New York, we built 2,900 hospital rooms, beds. Nobody has ever seen it before. The governor has never seen anything like that before. This was done by federal government, not by state government. This was done by the federal government. They're opening it tomorrow."
1486,2020-04-05,"I wanted to be there so badly but Secret Service and all of the people involved won't let me. They won't let me. I would love to be there, but they won't love me, for obvious reasons. But I would have loved to have been at the opening tomorrow of the hospital in New York, Javits Center — at Javits Center."
1487,2020-04-05,"But we're very proud of the job we've done. We've mobilized and getting better and better every day. And the task force, headed by your Vice President, the job they've done. And they don't even sleep."
1488,2020-04-05,"Okay, any other question?"
1489,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1490,2020-04-05,Sure. Yeah.
1491,2020-04-05,Yeah. We're ranking counties and we're ranking states. And a lot of people put out false information because they don't know what they're talking about.
1492,2020-04-05,"And we took over a dead, barren system. We took over a system that was obsolete. It was — it was good for a tiny, little sample of people. It was — and even that didn't work, because when CDC first looked at their test, the biggest problem they had is the test didn't work. That wasn't from us. That's been there a long time. Now we have the best tests in the world. And nobody has — now they're all calling: “Can we get the quick test?” We call it the “quick test,” where, by the way, probably more accurate and it takes a few minutes. I mean, it's pretty amazing what we've done."
1493,2020-04-05,"No, we're getting — we're getting along great with the governors."
1494,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead. Please."
1495,2020-04-05,"No, go ahead. Please."
1496,2020-04-05,"Yeah, thank you."
1497,2020-04-05,"Well, we hope not. But we think it's going to — you know, we have aspirational thoughts. We would have loved to have been a little bit sooner, but we have to do it right. We could have done it. We could have done it on Easter, but there was a good chance that if it's coming down or if it's still going up — maybe it's going to be coming down by then. But we just felt it was too soon."
1498,2020-04-05,"We can't take a chance. You know, again, because of what we've done and because of the fact that we've stopped the flow from China so early — because the question is, from a lot of my friends, “Why didn't we just wing it? Why didn't we just wing it?” And I kept asking, and we did models now. Finally, we got these models in. And you hear about the 2.2 million people would have died. I don't mean we would have had 2.2 million cases. These are 2.2 million people who would have died. 2.2 million people."
1499,2020-04-05,"Look, we're going to have a meeting or speech or press conference or something on Tuesday. I thought what I'd — I was going to announce the end of April on Tuesday, but I said let's do it now because somewhere along the line it's going to leak. We might as well just do it now and get rid of all the leaks. This way it did it nice and clean."
1500,2020-04-05,"But we have to really do a great job for another couple of weeks. And I think we're going to be in great shape. And we're going to be in a position, even with what we're trying to do with restaurants, with deductibility — we have to get these restaurants back in. We have to get our businesses open. We have to get the planes flying. We have to get everything going. We have to get even the cruise ships. I mean, we have to get those cruise ships moving along. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world, three weeks ago, and now we've said, “Please don't work anymore.” We're actually paying people not to work. Nobody has ever heard that. That's not for us. People want to work."
1501,2020-04-05,"But at the same time — and I'm so glad that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx gave us a number. And the number on the outside — and maybe it's not even on the outside; we don't know — is 2.2 million people would have died if we didn't do what we're doing. And now we're looking at numbers that are going to be much, much, much lower than that. And it makes everything we're doing feel much better to me."
1502,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
1503,2020-04-05,That would be fine. Finish it. Go ahead.
1504,2020-04-05,I was going to call on you next. You know that.
1505,2020-04-05,"Well, I could ask Dr. Fauci to come up, but it's common sense. You're going to have massive depression, meaning mental depression. You're going to have depression in the economy also. But you're going to have mental depression for people. You're going to have large numbers of suicides. Take a look at what happens in a really horrible recession, or worse."
1506,2020-04-05,"So you're going to have tremendous suicides, but you know what you're going to have more than anything else? Drug addiction. You will see drugs being used like nobody has ever used them before. And people are going to be dying all over the place from drug addiction, because you would have people that had a wonderful job at a restaurant, or even owned a restaurant."
1507,2020-04-05,"I spoke to great people today that have done a great job. And one day, at the top of their business, they're celebrity chefs, they've got the most successful restaurants, and in one day they have nothing. They've gotten wiped out. One day, from our enemy: this invisible, horrible scourge."
1508,2020-04-05,"So when you ask me that, it's — it's so easy to figure that. I mean, massive drug use, massive depression — mental depression, massive numbers of suicide. Anxiety causes, you know, disease, they say. A lot of people — you're going to have tremendous."
1509,2020-04-05,"And hopefully we're not going to have that, because hopefully, by what we're doing, we get the best of both worlds. We don't have 2.2 million deaths. We have a number that's much less — much, much less. And at the same time, we get our country running again."
1510,2020-04-05,Please. Thank you very much.
1511,2020-04-05,"You were next. He was very nice in doing it, though, nevertheless. Go ahead."
1512,2020-04-05,Which is unusual for CNN.
1513,2020-04-05,"I don't think so. It's a great question, actually. I don't think so. And I asked that the same. I said, “How about Nebraska? How about Idaho? How about Iowa?” And you know what? Those people are so great — the whole Midwest. They want to — I don't think they want to be in that position actually. And probably — I was given a pretty strong look by these two people. They said, “We don't like that idea.” So, you know, we're relying on them. They're the best in their profession, and they didn't like the idea."
1514,2020-04-05,"And we could do it, but I don't think it would be good."
1515,2020-04-05,But I didn't say that. I didn't say that.
1516,2020-04-05,"No, it's such a — excuse me. Ready? Ready? Ready? Take a look at what I said. I want them to be appreciative of me — okay? — and then you cut it off, because it's fake-news CNN."
1517,2020-04-05,"Listen. Just, please, let me just finish. You just said it again, and you know the answer is a lie."
1518,2020-04-05,"You know that your statement is a lie. Let me just say — look, your statement and your response and your answer is a lie, because here's the story. Are you ready? I said, “I want you to be appreciative of me,” and then you go on, and then I go on, and you cut it off. But it says, because when you're not —"
1519,2020-04-05,Thank you.
1520,2020-04-05,Thank you.
1521,2020-04-05,I don't call.
1522,2020-04-05,"No, I don't call. No, I don't call the governor of Washington now."
1523,2020-04-05,"But Mike Pence calls, and the head of FEMA calls. I don't stop them. Did I ever ask you to do anything negative, Mike, to Washington, the State of Washington?"
1524,2020-04-05,Michigan — I love that state. That's one of my favorite places in the whole world — Michigan. And I'm so proud of what's happened with the auto industry; it's coming back to Michigan.
1525,2020-04-05,"No, I don't have to call because I'm probably better off not, because we don't get — he's a failed presidential candidate. He's a nasty person. I don't like the governor of Washington. So you know who calls? I get Mike Pence to call. I get the head of FEMA to call. I get the Admiral to call."
1526,2020-04-05,"But what you didn't say — see, you started it off and you talked about “I have to be appreciated,” but then, when you read the rest, it said: Because if you don't appreciate, you're not respecting these incredible people — the two admirals. You're not appreciating FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers who built 2,900 beds in three and a half days, and you're not appreciating all of the work that's been done, and you're not appreciating these incredible people from private enterprise that are delivering things in numbers that nobody has ever seen."
1527,2020-04-05,"See, and that's why people aren't watching CNN very much anymore. That's why they don't like it. That's why your ratings are no good, because you even — after knowing the truth for days now, you bring up the old lie."
1528,2020-04-05,"Read the read — the rest of your question, the rest of your statement, you didn't put in. You have to put that in. And it said in there “FEMA,” and it said in there “Army Corps of Engineers.” Because when they disrespect me, they're disrespecting our government. And you know what? I don't mind if I'm disrespected, but they can't disrespect the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA."
1529,2020-04-05,"Okay. Please, go ahead."
1530,2020-04-05,"I want them to appreciate the incredible job we're doing. We are doing a job the likes of which has never been done before. And there are a couple of people that know that, but for political reasons — let's say they're Democrats; they don't want to give this administration credit, and that's okay. But I don't have to deal with them, but our Vice President does deal with them."
1531,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
1532,2020-04-05,But that's why CNN is not trusted anymore. They are not trusted. They are fake news. Remember that.
1533,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1534,2020-04-05,"Yes, you are."
1535,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1536,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1537,2020-04-05,"No, we think it's going to really start to open up. We think that that's going to be the bottom of the hill. That's where we're looking at — June 1st. Maybe even a little bit sooner than that."
1538,2020-04-05,"So we have this hill. If we did nothing, the hill would have been up here. We did a lot. We did just about maximum. And we got lucky, because we stopped China from coming in, and then later on we stopped Europe from — we got lucky. We got very lucky."
1539,2020-04-05,"The people that were coming in here, they went to Italy, they went to Spain, they went to other countries. We got lucky — and they got unlucky, to be honest with you. You look at what's going on in Italy and Spain, in particular."
1540,2020-04-05,"So, no, I don't want that. June 1st — we think we can reach the bottom of that hill on June 1st. And that would be a great thing. And I have confidence in the two of — the two doctors. I think that that could be a day. It could even be sooner. Could be a little bit later; it could be sooner. But I think people would be very happy if we did a job and saved, potentially, millions of lives. I think people would be very happy with that date."
1541,2020-04-05,"Okay. Yes, please. Go ahead, please."
1542,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1543,2020-04-05,"Well, I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary to, number one, save lives, and number two, bring our economy back strong just like it was before. I think our economy has a chance to be just as good and even better than it was before."
1544,2020-04-05,"And remember, a lot of the money that you read about, that's all coming back. These are loans to great companies that got stopped from doing business. They'll be back very soon. So much of the money that we're talking about, that money is coming back, and we'll take warrants — meaning, we'll take pieces of the company for the taxpayers of our nation."
1545,2020-04-05,"I expect that we'll make a lot of money with that money. We're going to make a lot of money, and that's okay. I don't even want to talk about making money, because what I want to talk about is two things: Number one is saving lives, and number two is bringing our economy back. Okay? But I think we're going to do very well. That whole money, a lot of it is coming back."
1546,2020-04-05,Please.
1547,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1548,2020-04-05,"No, I know exactly what you're saying. No, I've read that."
1549,2020-04-05,"Well, I've read that CNN doesn't want to cover them. I've read that — except they can't help them because their ratings are so high. You know, if the ratings were low, they wouldn't be here. This man wouldn't be here. In 100 years, you could bet your life that he would never be here with CNN and all their cameras, if they're bad, because we help their ratings. We help — we lift up their ratings because their ratings are very low."
1550,2020-04-05,"But for the most part, I haven't heard that. I will say, the Washington Post has a drive-on not to go to the President of the United States' news conference — because, frankly, so many people are watching. We're getting the word out. We're getting the accurate word out. And a lot of people are happy about it, and a lot of people aren't. But they should be happy."
1551,2020-04-05,"When I have the General, when I have Seema, and when I have Tony, and when I have our — our incred- — these are, like, people that have become big stars, okay? But they've done a great job. But Deborah has done a fantastic — all of these people. They — they don't want to be stars. You know what they want? They want to win. They want to win the battle against the vir- — they've been fighting this stuff their whole life, between Ebola and swine flu and — I don't know, I'm not sure I'd love your life, but that's what you like, right? That's what they do: They fight disease. And you know what? There's nobody that does it better."
1552,2020-04-05,"But I think the American public — ultimately, they should be the decider. It's like if they don't want to watch, they shouldn't watch. And we shouldn't have bigger ratings than “The Bachelor” or, as the New York Times said, we have Monday Night Football-type ratings. Now, I didn't say that. I have no idea what they are, in a sense, but I know that the Times, they say it's all the news that's fit to print. I say it's all the news that's not fit to print because I think they are not honest people, but that's okay. But they can't help it."
1553,2020-04-05,"But even they said that the ratings are like Monday Night Football ratings, and that these are like “Bachelor” finale — that's their end. When the big deal happened — I have no idea what happened because I'm too busy working on this. Someday you will tell me what happened."
1554,2020-04-05,"So, no, I think it's terrible. When they don't want the President of the United States to have a voice, you're not talking about democracy any longer."
1555,2020-04-05,Please. Thank you very much.
1556,2020-04-05,"No. No. And this is before we heard the 2.2 million people. I mean, we had a lot of people who were saying, “Maybe we shouldn't do anything. Just ride it.” They say, “Ride it like a cowboy. Just ride it. Ride that sucker right through.”"
1557,2020-04-05,"That's where the 2.2 million people come in, who would have died, maybe. But it would have been 1.6 to 2.2. And that's not acceptable. But there were a lot of people that said — I thought about it. I said, “Maybe we should ride it through.” You know, you always hear about the flu. I talk about it all the time. We had a bad flu season. We're in the midst of a bad flu season. You know, we had a bad season last year as an example. A bad flu season. And you'll have 35-, 36-, 37,000 people die, sometimes more, sometimes less."
1558,2020-04-05,"But this is different. And part of this is the unknown, and part of it also is the viciousness of it. I had a friend who went to a hospital the other day. He's a little older, and he's heavy, but he's tough person. And he went to the hospital, and a day later, he's in a coma. I call: “How's he doing?” “Sir, he's in a coma. He's unconscious.” He's not doing well."
1559,2020-04-05,"The speed and the viciousness, especially if it gets the right person, it's horrible. It's really horrible."
1560,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
1561,2020-04-05,"Yeah. I don't think it's a rumor. I think it's a fact. Louisiana has been hit hard. And Louisiana, as an example, it started off with like nobody for so long. I spoke — when I spoke to the governor. But Deborah or Tony? Any — either of you, if you'd like to talk."
1562,2020-04-05,"Well, I haven't. I think I'm waiting for that little 45-minute test. I sort of like that. Or now it's down to five minutes, I understand. But, no, I haven't. But I think I'll — I think I will take it again, if it's appropriate. I don't feel there's any symptoms. I don't notice — have you noticed any sniffles? Nothing, right? So far, I haven't felt that way."
1563,2020-04-05,"But, you know, there was a big, strong point made originally, and I think it still holds: Take the test if you need it, if you have the symptoms. If you don't, don't take it. That's put out by the professionals. So, you know, I don't have it. But I would — I would take it."
1564,2020-04-05,"I just wanted to say one thing also about what Tony had mentioned. So I grew up in Queens, New York, and right next to a place called Elmhurst, Queens. And they have a hospital that's a very good hospital — Elmhurst Hospital. Right? I've known it. I've known where it is. I can tell you the color on the outside, the size of the windows. I mean, I know it very well, right? That was near my community where I lived."
1565,2020-04-05,"And I've been watching that for the last week on television. Body bags all over in hallways. I've been watching them bring in trailer trucks — freezer trucks; they're freezer trucks — because they can't handle the bodies there's so many of them. This is in my — essentially, in my community in Queens — Queens, New York."
1566,2020-04-05,"I've seen things that I've never seen before. I mean, I've seen them, but I've seen them on television in faraway lands. I've never seen them in our country. Elmhurst Hospital — unbelievable people. I mean, I — when I see the trucks pull up to take out bodies — and these are trucks that are as long as the Rose Garden. And they're pulling up to take out bodies, and you look inside and you see the black body bags. You say, “What's in there?” It's Elmhurst Hospital; must be supplies. It's not supplies. It's people. I've never seen anything like it."
1567,2020-04-05,"So, we're doing — these people are doing a fantastic job. And somebody else who's doing a fantastic job is sitting here, who is the head of the task force. And I just maybe want to finish off because I'd like to ask Mike — what do you think about what we've done and where do you think we're going? And how do you feel also — and you've studied this so closely — how do you feel about the curve and the June 1st date? And that's a very — that's aspirational. But I think that's, really, modified aspirational, because I think we're going to hit it. And maybe we'll even beat it."
1568,2020-04-05,"Okay, Mike? Please."
1569,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Mike. Thank you very much, Mike. So I just want to end by saying that we're all in this together, all of us. I have never seen anything like it. The unity, the esprit de corps, the spirit — I've never seen anything like it. It's a beautiful thing to watch."
1570,2020-04-05,"Unfortunately, the enemy is death. It's death. A lot of people are dying, so it's very unpleasant. It's a very unpleasant thing to go through. But the level of competence, the level of caring, the level of love, I — I just think it's brilliant, and it's possibly happening in other countries. Possibly. I don't know. I can't speak to other countries, but I can speak to the United States of America."
1571,2020-04-05,"And I've said it before and I'll say it again: I am very proud to be your President. Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
1572,2020-04-05,"Okay, thank you very much, everybody. All these people have been working very, very hard today, I'll tell you. For a long time, they've been working."
1573,2020-04-05,"But before I begin, I want to express our nation's well wishes to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he wages his own personal fight with the virus. All Americans are praying for him. He's a friend of mine. He's a great gentleman and a great leader. And he's — as you know, he was brought to the hospital today, but I'm hopeful and sure that he's going to be fine. He's a strong man, a strong person."
1574,2020-04-05,"Today, every patriotic American heart beats in solidarity with the incredible people of New York and New Jersey. They've really become a very hot zone, but some very good things are happening. In New York, the first time where the deaths were less from the previous day. That's the first drop so far. So maybe that's a good sign; it could be. And the hospital levels are starting to perhaps decrease. It's been very short, but perhaps decrease."
1575,2020-04-05,"So we wish Governor Cuomo and all of the people in New York great. And, New Jersey, your governor is doing a great job. He's doing a great job in New Jersey. They got hit very hard."
1576,2020-04-05,"I just want to say that the full power of the American government and American enterprise — it really is. This is an all-out military operation that we've waged, and especially over the last number of weeks. Fifty states and territories have now been approved for major disaster declarations, which is very unusual."
1577,2020-04-05,"Thanks to the Army Corps of Engineers, New York City's Javits Center is now one of the largest hospitals in the United States. It's designated for treatment of the virus patients and staffed by hundreds of federal medical personnel deployed from two Army hospital units, and they're doing a great job. This was something that we didn't expect to do, but they needed help in New York and we sent federal troops — not only troops, we also sent a lot of very talented doctors, nurses, first responders. People are now running Javits."
1578,2020-04-05,"Also, as you know, the USNS Comfort, which is in New York — there's been a lot of publicity about that coming in and all. That was not supposed to be for the virus at all, under any circumstances. But it looks like, more and more, we're going to be using it for that. So we'll see. That was supposed to be for people having other medical problems, but it's very interesting because there are virtually no cars on the road, no motorcycles on the road, no — no anything on the road. Things that would normally be taken care of, we don't see anymore. So we haven't seen that in a long time. It's, perhaps, a positive."
1579,2020-04-05,"But the ship is ready. And if it has to, if we need it — if we need it for the virus, we will be using it for that. They'd prefer not, for obvious reasons, but if for any reason they need it, it's ready, willing, and able."
1580,2020-04-05,"We have the best doctors, the best military leaders, and the best logistics professionals anywhere in the world. And we're orchestrating a massive federal response unlike anything our country has ever seen or done. We've never done anything like this. And, more and more, we're using our medical people because of the fact that jurisdictions, states — in particular New York, New Jersey, the Connecticut area. Long Island now has become a hotspot — part of New York. We're sending a lot of things, a lot of supplies, and now we're sending personnel where it's needed. Military personnel."
1581,2020-04-05,"As of Tuesday, we'll have deployed over 3,000 military and public health professionals to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and other parts of our country — 3,000 — and that number is going up. And we hope we're seeing a leveling off in the hottest spots of them all. So we'll see. You'll be seeing that over the next few days. Let's see what happens. But we're prepared."
1582,2020-04-05,"In the last seven days, FEMA has airlifted critical supplies and protective equipment from every corner of Earth. They're coming from all over the planet, including from within the United States, where the equipment isn't as necessary."
1583,2020-04-05,"Since last Sunday, cargo planes have delivered almost — listen to this — 300 million gloves, almost 8 million masks, and 3 million gowns. And many more fully loaded cargo planes are right now on the way. Three big ones landed today. And these supplies are being distributed directly to the hospitals and healthcare providers all across the nation so that that massive amount of material that we're getting in is being delivered all over the country."
1584,2020-04-05,"Tomorrow, we'll deliver an additional 600,000 N95 masks to New York City to take care of the needs of the public hospital system. It was requested — Mayor de Blasio. We've been working great with Mayor de Blasio, getting him a lot of stuff. He's working very hard; I can tell you that. And we're working, really, very hard with New York City and with New York State."
1585,2020-04-05,"And at the request of Congressman Lee Zeldin, out in Long Island, we will also be delivering another 200,000 N95 masks to Suffolk County, where they need it very badly. So we're getting that out on an emergency basis. It should be there tomorrow."
1586,2020-04-05,We'll also be deploying millions of N95 masks to other locations that Admiral Polowczyk will detail shortly. The Admiral will be up in just a couple of minutes.
1587,2020-04-05,"Over the last 24 hours, FEMA has delivered an additional 500 ventilators to New Jersey. Five hundred. And again, the governor has been very thankful. We're working very hard with New Jersey, including building hospitals."
1588,2020-04-05,"We've also sent an additional 200 ventilators to Louisiana — a definite hotspot. Three hundred to Michigan — working very well, I think, with the governor."
1589,2020-04-05,"Amazingly, 600 will be going or have gone to Illinois. And, I mean, there's a governor — I hear him complaining all the time — Pritzker. I hear him; he's always complaining. And yet, I just said, “Give me a list of a couple of the things we've done in Illinois.” And we're building a 2,500-bed hospital in McCormick Place; that's the big convention center in Chicago. And we're helping to staff it and probably will end up staffing it because he's not able to do what you're supposed to be able to do as a governor. He has not performed well."
1590,2020-04-05,And we're also sending 100 ventilators to Massachusetts.
1591,2020-04-05,"So we have 600 to Illinois. We have 100 to Massachusetts. We have 300 to Michigan. We have 200 to Louisiana. We have 500 ventilators — 500 — going to New Jersey. And this is being done by FEMA. It's being delivered by FEMA. And it's — that's some job. Just think of that. When you think about 500 ventilators, a ventilator is a big deal."
1592,2020-04-05,"We're also establishing a federal medical station in the Washington, D.C., area to help Washington, D.C., and working very closely with the mayor and everybody in Washington, D.C."
1593,2020-04-05,"At the same time, Governor Inslee — we appreciate this — of Washington State has returned 400 ventilators, which can now be deployed elsewhere in our country. So the State of Washington has done very well. They won't be needing some of the ventilators that have been sent — about 400. That's a lot. And we appreciate that he's able to give them back. He feels confident that they are in good shape for the coming weeks, until we can declare a final victory."
1594,2020-04-05,"In the days ahead, America will endure the peak of this terrible pandemic. Our warriors in this life-and-death battle are the incredible doctors and nurses and healthcare workers on the frontline of the fight. We pledge to them our eternal gratitude and everlasting support. They make all of us very proud. Our country is very proud. We have people — they love our country. The world loves our country, most of it. Probably all of it; they just don't say it."
1595,2020-04-05,"I can report today that the United States has now tested and given results — gotten results of 1.67 million people. That's far more than any other country has been able to do. And you remember, we inherited a broken system. So a lot of this has been developed."
1596,2020-04-05,"By Tuesday, 1,200 brand-new rapid point-of-care testing kits has been produced by Abbott Laboratories. A great company. And they'll be distributed to all of our public health labs — that's a 15-minute test; even less — as well as the Indian Health Service, the CDC, and the Strategic National Stockpile."
1597,2020-04-05,"So we're going to have 1,200. And on a weekly basis, we're making a lot more. They go very fast. They're very accurate tests. And other countries are wanting them. So, at the right time, we'll be able to do that. But right now, we're getting them to all of ours."
1598,2020-04-05,"So we've done 1,670,000 tests. Think of that: 1,670,000 tests. And we have a great system now. We're working with the states in almost all instances, but we have a great system."
1599,2020-04-05,"And the other thing that we bought a tremendous amount of is the hydroxychloroquine — hydroxychloroquine — which I think — as you know, it's a great malaria drug. It's worked unbelievably. It's this powerful drug on malaria. And there are signs that it works on this. Some very strong signs. And, in the meantime, it's been around a long time. It also works very powerfully on lupus. Lupus."
1600,2020-04-05,"So there are some very strong, powerful signs, and we'll have to see. Because again, it's being tested now. This is a new thing that just happened to us — the “invisible enemy,” we call it."
1601,2020-04-05,"And, if you can, if you have a — no signs of heart problems, the azrithromycin [sic] — azithromycin — which will kill certain things that you don't want living within your body — it's powerful drug — if you don't have a problem, a heart problem, we would say: Let your doctor think about it. But as a combination, I think they're going to be — I think they're two things that should be looked at very strongly."
1602,2020-04-05,"Now, we have purchased and we have stockpiled 29 million pills of the hydroxychloroquine — 29 million. A lot of drugstores have them by prescription, and also — and they're not expensive. Also, we're sending them to various labs, our military. We're sending them to the hospitals. We're sending them all over."
1603,2020-04-05,"I just think it's something — you know the expression, I've used it for certain reasons: “What do you have to lose?” What do you have to lose? And a lot of people are saying that when — and are taking it — if you're a doctor, a nurse, a first responder, a medical person going into hospitals, they say taking it before the fact is good. But what do you have to lose? They say, “Take it.”"
1604,2020-04-05,"I'm not looking at it one way or the other, but we want to get out of this. If it does work, it would be a shame if we didn't do it early. But we have some very good signs. So that's hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin."
1605,2020-04-05,"And, again, you have to go through your medical people, get the approval. But I've seen things that I sort of like. So what do I know? I'm not a doctor. I'm not a doctor. But I have common sense. The FDA feels good about it. They've — as you know, they've approved it. They gave it a rapid approval. And the reason: because it's been out there for a long time and they know the side effects and they also know the potential. So, based on that, we have sent it throughout the country and we have it stockpiled — about 29 million doses. Twenty-nine million doses. We have a lot of it. We hope it works."
1606,2020-04-05,"Driven by the goal of the brightest minds in science — we have the brightest minds in science, but we're driven by the goal of getting rid of this plague, getting rid of this scourge, getting rid of this virus. These brilliant minds are working on the most effective antiviral therapies and vaccines. We are working very, very hard. I have met many of the doctors that are doing it. These are doctors that are working so hard on vanquishing the virus."
1607,2020-04-05,"They're staying — we strongly recommend staying at home, practicing vigorous hygiene, and maintaining social distance, so you're — you're just not going to catch it. It's the most effective weapon in this war."
1608,2020-04-05,"And I will tell you, the — we are committing to the — to you. We're committing to the people of our country like few administrations, few people, few professionals have ever committed before. They are — they are working so hard. I see them. I see them before my eyes, exhausted — people that I'm dealing with every day, exhausted. They haven't left their offices. They haven't left their hospitals. We meet with them. We see them."
1609,2020-04-05,"And tremendous strides have been made. I think the vaccines — we'll have a report on that. But the vaccines — we're working together with other countries. We're also working with other countries — many other countries. And we all want everyone else to be first. We're very happy. But we are very far down the line on vaccines. We'll see how that all works. Johnson &amp; Johnson is doing a great job, working very hard. A vaccine would be great. Therapy — a therapy and therapeutics would be great. We'll see what happens. In the meantime, you may listen to what I said about the two drugs mentioned."
1610,2020-04-05,My administration is rapidly implementing the largest emergency economic relief package in American history. You've seen what's been happening. Billions of dollars in small- business loans have already been processed through Paycheck Protection Programs.
1611,2020-04-05,"So we went out on Friday and, literally, it's become so popular. It's been worked with the banks. They get it to the small business. It's all about employment. It's all about jobs. We want you to keep your jobs. It gives small business funding to keep the workers on the payroll. And we're sending direct cash payments to millions of Americans and rushing aid to the hardest-hit industries. We're saving industries. We will be — you'll be seeing it. And if we do more, we're going to do more, and we're going to try and get directly to people that are hit so hard."
1612,2020-04-05,"But we're going to take care of our workers. We're going to take care of our citizens. We're going to take care of our small businesses. We're going to take care of our large businesses: the airplane industry, the — the airline industry. A lot of great industries that we have that are in trouble because of what took place over the last short period of time."
1613,2020-04-05,"These are industries that were doing better — for the most part, doing better than ever. The airlines were doing great. Oil was doing great — oil and gas. And the energy industry was doing phenomenally well, and it got hit like nobody has ever been hit before. Just about like no industry has ever been hit before. There's never been anything like this."
1614,2020-04-05,"But we see light at the end of the tunnel. Things are happening. Things are happening. We're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. And hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, we'll be very proud of the job we all did. We can never be happy when so many people are dying, but we're going to be very proud of the job we did to keep the death down to an absolute minimum — the least it could have happened with this terrible, terrible virus."
1615,2020-04-05,"In closing, I also want to note today is Palm Sunday and the beginning of Holy Week for Christians in America and all around the world. While we may be apart from one another, as you can see from our great churches, our great pastors and ministers are out there working very hard. But we may be apart — we can use this time to turn to reflection and prayer and our own personal relationship with God."
1616,2020-04-05,"I would ask that all Americans pray for the heroic doctors and nurses, for the truck drivers and grocery store workers, and for everyone fighting this battle. I had mentioned yesterday, where I see the nurses rushing into hospitals, and they're putting on their outfits, and they're putting on their masks and goggles, in some cases. They're rushing into war. They're rushing into war."
1617,2020-04-05,"And I see people from apartment houses screaming and shouting and singing their praises. It's an incredible thing. They're warriors — these doctors and nurses. They're running into buildings, and they're literally putting it on as the doors are opening. They're putting all their stuff and running inside. And they're running inside to tremendous danger. Tremendous danger."
1618,2020-04-05,"But, most of all, I'd like to ask for your prayers for the families who have lost loved ones. Ask God to comfort them in their hour of grief. It's a great hour of grief for our nation, for the world."
1619,2020-04-05,"This morning — I was talking 151. For four days, I said 151. A hundred and fifty-one countries. This morning, it's 182 countries. It jumped up a lot. So, as of this morning, it's 182 countries are under attack from this monster."
1620,2020-04-05,"With the faith of our families and the spirit of our people, and the grace of our God, we will endure, we will overcome, we will prevail. We have learned so much. We will be stronger than ever."
1621,2020-04-05,And I just want to thank everybody. I want to thank the incredible professionals on the task force also. We had a big meeting today. We — were calls all day long to so many different people. And I think our package to get everyone working when we're ready is really turning out to be successful. We may have to make it larger because it's been really successful. But all of that comes back to this country. We want to get them back. We want to get our people back to work. Everybody wants to be back. We want to open up our country as soon as possible.
1622,2020-04-05,"So, with that, I'm going to ask Dr. Birx to say a few words, and she's got some charts to show you. And thank you very much. Thank you."
1623,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Admiral? Please.
1624,2020-04-05,Hydroxy.
1625,2020-04-05,"Great job. Thank you very much, Admiral. Mike, please."
1626,2020-04-05,"Oh, good."
1627,2020-04-05,Good.
1628,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Robert."
1629,2020-04-05,Thank you.
1630,2020-04-05,Mike?
1631,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Mike, very much. Thank you."
1632,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Yeah.
1633,2020-04-05,"They do get orders for a lot more than sometimes we think an area needs. Generally speaking, we like to either negotiate that down or give it to them as they want."
1634,2020-04-05,"So we've had a lot of orders that we think are high, but we generally like, if we have it — if we have, for instance, with the medicines and with other things, we like to give it to them."
1635,2020-04-05,"Every day, we're building up and building it up very rapidly, and deploying it. But we do get orders from some of the states where we don't think they need it. We try and get it for them what they want anyway."
1636,2020-04-05,Okay? Go ahead.
1637,2020-04-05,Yes.
1638,2020-04-05,"I didn't speak to him, no. I did get a call from the ambassador. And, hey, it's a big — it's a big move, going to the hospital. That's a big thing."
1639,2020-04-05,"He's a great gentleman, so I — you know, I just hope he's okay."
1640,2020-04-05,Yes.
1641,2020-04-05,"Well, we're talking about it, and we're talking about doing something for them. But we're really looking at the conclusion. We want to just — we don't want to focus on that now. They're incredible. There's — they're not saying, “We're not doing it.” They go in with good equipment, with great equipment, and with stuff that's not so good. And sometimes they catch it wearing the best stuff you can buy — brand new, the best stuff."
1642,2020-04-05,"This is a very tough enemy. But these are amazing people. No, we are talking about something, but we're really thinking about, let's get it finished first before we do that."
1643,2020-04-05,Please.
1644,2020-04-05,A tough — tough week.
1645,2020-04-05,"I don't think they're so different. I think we all know that we have to reach a certain point, and that point is going to be a horrific point in terms of death. But it's also a point at which things are going to start changing."
1646,2020-04-05,"We're getting very close to that level right now. And the next week and a half, two weeks are going to be — I think they're going to be very difficult."
1647,2020-04-05,"At the same time, we understand what they represent and what that time represents, and hopefully we can get this over with because this is a very horrible thing for the world. Hey, look, we're one country out of 182 now that have — 182 countries."
1648,2020-04-05,I have a friend of mine — said he didn't know we had so many countries in the world. A hundred and eighty-two countries are now affected by this. So we want to get it over with. Okay?
1649,2020-04-05,Please.
1650,2020-04-05,Yes.
1651,2020-04-05,"Well, we hope we can stay under those numbers. Those are numbers of death. And we hope we can stay under those numbers. That would be terrific. And as far under those numbers as possible."
1652,2020-04-05,"Now, if we did nothing, you know that number too. But the American people really stepped up; so did the professionals. They just really stepped up. So we're hoping to stay under those numbers."
1653,2020-04-05,"And that means the minimum and the maximum, but we're hoping to stay under the minimum number. You know what that number was."
1654,2020-04-05,"I would say the answer is “yes,” but I would also say that we're not going to know really in terms of a final toll until we get out to the end. And we're probably, possibly, not so far away. We're getting closer. But it's our goal to stay as far under that minimum number — the minimum number as possible. Okay? That's what we want to do."
1655,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1656,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1657,2020-04-05,"Because I want people to live and I'm seeing people dying. And I see people that are going to die without it. And you know the expression. When that's happening, they should do it. What really do we have to lose?"
1658,2020-04-05,"We also have — this medicine has been tested for many years for malaria and for lupus, so it's been out there. So it's a very strong, powerful medicine, but it doesn't kill people. We have some very good results and some very good tests. You've seen the same test that I have."
1659,2020-04-05,"In France, they had a very good test; they're continuing. But we don't have time to go and say, “Gee, let's take a couple of years and test it out. And let's go and test with the test tubes and the laboratories.” We don't have time. I'd love to do that. But we have people dying today. As we speak, there are people dying. If it works, that would be great. If it doesn't work — we know, for many years, malaria, it — it's incredible what it's done for malaria; it's incredible what it's done for lupus. But it doesn't kill people."
1660,2020-04-05,"That's one of the things with a vaccine. When we have a vaccine, we have to do tests because when you inject that vaccine, when they take whatever ever it is they have to take, we have to make sure it doesn't have a horrible impact, destroy somebody. Good? So we have to test it for a long period of time. This one, not so much because it's been out there."
1661,2020-04-05,"Now, I'm not acting as a doctor. I'm saying, “Do what you want, but there are some good signs.” You've read the signs, I've read the signs. With the other one, there's some very good signs also. Different — going together works very well. But there may be an indication that if you have a problem with your heart, you shouldn't take what we call the Z-Pak. You shouldn't take it, and that's okay."
1662,2020-04-05,"But I would love to go to a laboratory and spend a couple of years testing something. We don't have time. We don't have two hours, because there are people dying right now. If it does help, great. If it doesn't help, we gave it a shot. We gave it a shot. That's the way I feel."
1663,2020-04-05,"You know, we passed something — yeah, I would — I would be very serious about taking it."
1664,2020-04-05,"We passed something that I'm very proud of. It's called Right to Try. For 45, 50 years, they've been trying. It makes so much sense. We have the greatest doctors and labs and lab technicians, the greatest medicines, the greatest minds in the world. Everybody admits it. And when we're close to having something, or when we have something that tests incredibly well, you couldn't use it for years because they would take years and years to test."
1665,2020-04-05,"So with the help of also Democrats — I got it bipartisan, but they've been trying to get this passed for — for decades. You know that. It's called Right to Try. So a person would be diagnosed terminally ill from something. And in the old days, meaning before a year ago, they would say, “Do you think I could try this — this pill, this whatever, this medicine that's testing so well?” “No, you can't do that. You can't do that under no circumstances.” They'd leave for Asia, they'd leave for Europe, they'd leave for — if they had money. If they had no money, they'd go home and die with no hope."
1666,2020-04-05,"We got a thing called Right to Try. If somebody is very ill, terminally ill, they're going to die. They — and it was very complex. It wasn't as easy as it sounds because there were huge liability problems. The drug companies didn't want to do it because they didn't want it on test results — because these are very sick people, so they didn't want to bring down their test results. The insurance companies had tremendous problems."
1667,2020-04-05,"I got everybody in the room, I said, “Look, we'll sign a waiver.” The person taking it will say, “We're not going to sue.” The family is not going to sue the drug company, not going to sue the insurance company, not going to sue the state, the city, or the federal government. Okay? It's called “exculpation.” And we got it done. It's a very simple agreement. I don't know why nobody ever thought of it, but they never thought of it. I did. And we got it done."
1668,2020-04-05,"Now we have Right to Try, which is actually, in my opinion, much more difficult than what we're talking about here. But if there's a medicine or something, a possible cure, or something that's looking good and somebody has something that's going — they're going to die or they're very sick, they take it. And, you know, we've had some unbelievable results. Unbelievable results. And it also gives the people hope."
1669,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
1670,2020-04-05,That's true. And many of them do.
1671,2020-04-05,Sure.
1672,2020-04-05,Sure.
1673,2020-04-05,They should be finished in about a year.
1674,2020-04-05,I'm not. I'm not. I'm just saying —
1675,2020-04-05,— very simply. I'm not at all. I'm not.
1676,2020-04-05,"Look, you know what I'm trying to do? I'm trying to save lives."
1677,2020-04-05,"I want them to try it. And it may work, and it may not work. But if it doesn't work, it's nothing lost by doing it. Nothing."
1678,2020-04-05,"Because we know — long term, what I want, I want to save lives. And I don't want it to be in a lab for the next year and a half as people are dying all over the place."
1679,2020-04-05,That's right.
1680,2020-04-05,"All I'm doing is saying — well, I'll tell you what I accomplish. We bought massive amounts of it — 29 million doses of it. We have it coming from all of the labs. We're actually now doing it here, because in case it does work, we want to have it. And we've given it to drugstores, we're — we're sending it all over. FEMA is doing it. FEMA is doing it. We're doing it through different channels, many different channels, including the companies that make it."
1681,2020-04-05,"It's a very special thing. Now, it may not work, in which case, hey, it didn't work. And it may work, in which case, it's going to save a lot of lives. Now, a lot of people say, if the people walking in prior to getting it, if they take it, it has a profound effect. Well, maybe it does and maybe it doesn't."
1682,2020-04-05,I don't want to wait a year and a half to find out.
1683,2020-04-05,And only CNN would ask that question. Fake news.
1684,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1685,2020-04-05,A bunch of fakers.
1686,2020-04-05,"I also think that Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx are very impressed with the American people. And I'm not going to put words in anybody's mouth — I would never do that — but I am, and I will say that they are doing maybe a better job than we all thought even possible."
1687,2020-04-05,"When you look at streets in New York where there's nobody in the street, no cars, no nothing — I see it. You know, I've seen those streets for a long time and they're packed all the time. And now you see there's nobody. You look at other places; you look at what's going on in California where they're doing a fantastic job. They really are. The governor is doing great. I'm proud of them. I'm proud of a lot of people — proud of a lot of people on the other side. You know, of a lot of people."
1688,2020-04-05,"Really — I'm really delighted to work with people that, frankly, on other issues, I didn't get along so well with. We disagree on this or that; we don't have to go into that now. But we're getting along with a lot of people. And they're happy with us. We're happy with them."
1689,2020-04-05,"But I really believe that the American people are doing a better job than anybody would have thought even possible, and that's one of the reasons we can even be talking about the kind of number that we hopefully will be talking about, which is at the minimum level instead of the maximum or beyond. It's not even the maximum — it's much beyond a maximum level, which would be horrific."
1690,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
1691,2020-04-05,Please.
1692,2020-04-05,"Well, it was voluntary, as I saw it yesterday. And certainly, if they'd want to, I would — I would encourage it. I would have absolutely no problem with that if they wanted."
1693,2020-04-05,"We had a long meeting today. There's good separation. But the task force meets and I would certainly have absolutely no problem if they wanted to. I think, frankly, it's something, at least for a period of time, where it might be advisable. And you know, it's advisory. And we'll see what happens."
1694,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
1695,2020-04-05,"Not here. No, not here. No, no, no —"
1696,2020-04-05,"Well, no, you've seen in Spain and you've seen in different — they're not sending faulty things to us."
1697,2020-04-05,"No, we test it. We look at it. We check it out."
1698,2020-04-05,Please.
1699,2020-04-05,And we're also sending it to other — from other locations.
1700,2020-04-05,"And when it comes to the ventilators, which are very complex, we are now building — we have now, under construction, literally thousands of ventilators. So — but so far, I think our projections on ventilators have been right. They've been correct."
1701,2020-04-05,Did you have something? For who?
1702,2020-04-05,"Well, it's turning out that we need less hospital beds."
1703,2020-04-05,"That's what you're talking about. And that's what we — well, we may have models, but we've been sort of saying that. In New York, we were saying we think you're going to need less. Now, let's hope that continues. But right now — I heard Governor Cuomo this morning, and he was saying less hospital beds, also less death. That was a very big thing. First time — less death today than yesterday, right? That's a big thing. But also less hospital beds. That means less patients because basically it's less patients. And we were saying that. And it also means less ventilators. So there's a lot of — a lot of very positive things happening."
1704,2020-04-05,Okay. Please.
1705,2020-04-05,Yes.
1706,2020-04-05,We have — we have this tiny platform and I'd love it to be wider. You're staying away from each other.
1707,2020-04-05,"Mike, you were tested?"
1708,2020-04-05,"Okay. Like recently. So was I, a couple of days ago."
1709,2020-04-05,"We are. We are. We are. You know, here we are on this platform. And — but I get next to him, I don't breathe. I'm only kidding. We are — we are sometimes forced into positions that I'd rather — I'd rather be away, but it's — you know, you're all looking for questions. Mike is a very big part of this; I am. It's very difficult maintaining like, this distance on this little area."
1710,2020-04-05,"Well, if the oil price stays the way it is because of people that really want to see it go up — when I say get — we want to save a great industry. We built a great industry in this country. If they don't get along, I would do that. Yeah, I would do tariffs, very substantial tariffs. Because we're independent now; we have our own oil."
1711,2020-04-05,"And if I did the tariffs, we essentially would be saying, “We don't want foreign oil. We don't want any foreign oil. We're just going to use our oil.” And that would help to save an industry. And, you know, it's become a tremendous job producer. And it's great to be independent. We're independent. Our energy is now independent. We produce more oil than — oil and gas than anybody else, than any other country. And that all took place over the very recent time."
1712,2020-04-05,"Now, in the meantime, I'm seeing 91 dollars — 91 cents a gallon out on the road. Okay? A lot of people are happy. I see very inexpensive jet fuel. We're trying to save the airline industry. But I want to save our great energy industry and that's what we're doing."
1713,2020-04-05,"Yeah. So I would — I would absolutely do that. And what we'll do — the price will still be very low — but what we'll do is we'll save — and, very importantly, we'll save tens of thousands of jobs."
1714,2020-04-05,"One of the other things we're doing is having oil shipped to our strategic oil reserves. Okay? And, you know, we're buying it for the right price and we're shipping it. In some cases, we're storing it for nothing. They're there. We're filling up our reserves with this very inexpensive oil. Nobody thought they'd ever see a price — this is like from the 1950s, where they had big dollars, okay?"
1715,2020-04-05,"So, no, I would use tariffs if I had to. I don't think I'm going to have to because Russia doesn't benefit by having this and Saudi Arabia doesn't benefit by having it. They — you know, oil and gas are their major sources of income. So it's obviously very bad for them."
1716,2020-04-05,"But we have to — we have an industry that's a very important industry and it's really formed beautifully. It was the virus that killed it because what happened is it's down 40 percent from the day this happened — 40 percent. Otherwise, it would be doing phenomenally well. So that's it."
1717,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1718,2020-04-05,"No, but I like the concept of it. I think it's good. We're talking about a different way of doing it, but I like the concept."
1719,2020-04-05,"I like the concept of infrastructure. Our country has to be rebuilt. They spent all this money in the Middle East — $8 trillion. We're up to now $8 trillion in the Middle East. We got to rebuild our country. Okay? We have to rebuild our roads, and our schools, our bridges. We have to rebuild our country. So, I like an infrastructure bill."
1720,2020-04-05,I also like money going directly to people. It's not their fault that this happened.
1721,2020-04-05,"And I do think this — especially the faster we can get it open, our country — can you believe we're talking about our country, getting our country open? The faster we get it open, the bigger the boom, the bigger the rocket ship going up. I think it has a chance to go really quickly, relatively quickly. I'd like to see very quickly, but we'll see."
1722,2020-04-05,"But part of the stimulus and part of what we're doing, that will help it. And the nice part is we're paying practically zero interest rates. You know we're paying very little. It's one of the reasons I like the infrastructure bill, because we're borrowing — we have a strong dollar. And the advantage to a strong dollar is everybody wants to invest in this country. They all want to buy our dollar."
1723,2020-04-05,"I think so. Yeah, from what I'm hearing that's —"
1724,2020-04-05,"Yeah, a couple of weeks. That's what I'm hearing. Yeah."
1725,2020-04-05,Please.
1726,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we — we discussed it with the staff. We discussed it with FDA. Well, the FDA approved it. So, you know — which is another point. I mean it's been approved by FDA, which is very important. If it wasn't approved by FDA, then I couldn't do this. But FDA has approved it, the hydroxy."
1727,2020-04-05,"Well, we'll see if it works. No, it's not going to — it's not going to hurt people. It can help them, but it's not going to hurt them. That's the beauty of it, you see. It can help them, but it's not going to hurt them. What do you have to lose?"
1728,2020-04-05,"Okay, a question? Yeah, in the back, please."
1729,2020-04-05,Right.
1730,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to have to — we'll answer that question later. All I can say is that right now things are looking now things are looking really good and opening up with a bang will be a great thing. And there's nobody going to be happier than me."
1731,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
1732,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1733,2020-04-05,Thirty-two thousand will be what?
1734,2020-04-05,In addition to the ones that we've already sent?
1735,2020-04-05,"Don't forget, we have almost 10,000 — a little more 9,000 right now. And those are ready to rock should we need them."
1736,2020-04-05,And we had to keep it. You understand that: flexibility. So that if we need them in New York — which we might not — if we need them. But they're ready to move. We have — we're all ready. Military — it's a military operation. We are ready to move. They'll be moved immediately into whatever section of the country we need.
1737,2020-04-05,Would you like to answer that by the way?
1738,2020-04-05,Yes.
1739,2020-04-05,"No, but they're not going to be long. They've started. GM, Ford, we have many — we have 11 companies — approximately 11 companies — building them. And we're going to have a stockpile for future — hopefully, we never have to use them. They should have — the hospitals, the states should have bought a stockpile. They didn't do that. So we've made up for it."
1740,2020-04-05,"But if we have extras — other countries need them. I mean, you see UK needs them badly, France needs a badly, Italy needs them badly. They need them. So, it's complicated. It's a big piece of equipment. It's expensive. And we'll be able to help other countries after we take care of our needs."
1741,2020-04-05,"Yes, please. Go ahead."
1742,2020-04-05,"I actually choose you, but that's okay."
1743,2020-04-05,I'll let him go. That's all right. Go ahead.
1744,2020-04-05,"No, I know. And because they don't do construction techniques that work and that are better. I mean, I see a highway and that's — which is what I do. I do construction — what I did."
1745,2020-04-05,"I see highway that's good but it's got a bad top, and it's got a big base — concrete base underneath. And I'll see them come in — I don't want to say where, but I could tell you; I could give you plenty of examples — and they rip the hell out of it. They take out the base. They take out everything. Now they pour a new base that isn't as good, isn't as deep, isn't as thick. The concrete base was fantastic — the footing. It takes forever."
1746,2020-04-05,"Wait a minute. It takes forever. And instead of scraping out the asphalt, or whatever may be the top — scraping it off and putting the new asphalt down, putting the new median in. They could have done it."
1747,2020-04-05,"And then they open the highway and it starts to crack. The reason is because it hasn't been set. And they spend 10, 15, 20 times more money than they have to. I never believe, when I watch these people doing highways and doing roadways and doing work, how they take the most expensive solution. And the bottom line: The job itself is far worse."
1748,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1749,2020-04-05,"Well, yeah, but hopefully they're not going to be staying at home for long. Hopefully, this will be out and we're not going to have that kind of time. If we have that kind of time, we made a big mistake."
1750,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
1751,2020-04-05,Who has that information?
1752,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Mike."
1753,2020-04-05,Tuesday they go out.
1754,2020-04-05,"Some have gone out, by the way, but the big bulk of them go out on Tuesday."
1755,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
1756,2020-04-05,No.
1757,2020-04-05,"No, there's not a change, but we're supposed to be the backup. But like in Illinois, the governor couldn't do his job so we had to help him. We're sending 600 ventilators. We're building a hospital in McCormick Place. We're doing it."
1758,2020-04-05,"So we have some people that were not able to do. We have other people that needed a little help. We had — in New York, we had to give a lot of help, but we've worked very well with Governor Cuomo and with Mayor de Blasio."
1759,2020-04-05,"But, no, we are meant to be the backup, but we've taken on a much bigger role than that, and that's okay. I have no objection to it."
1760,2020-04-05,"Now, in some cases, it's worked so well, where they're actually now seeing — they think they're over — over the big problem. And they're actually calling us and they're saying, “You can take your equipment back now.” But we're really deployed as a backup, but I feel we're much more than that. They've done a much better job."
1761,2020-04-05,"I will say this: I don't think that the people that have represented this country, the federal government — whether it's the Admiral and the generals and all of the people that we call to the fore — I just — they're heroes for what they've done. What they've been able to do in a short period of time — they took a system that was broken, just like we did the military. Our military was broken. Our military was depleted and it was broken, and we've rebuilt our military. We've rebuilt this whole system too."
1762,2020-04-05,"And I — in a way, Kelly, I appreciate your question because, you know, you're hearing all of the things that we're — the millions of masks, the hundreds of thousands of gowns. And they're surgical — you know, they're protective gowns at the highest level. We're getting it to the various states. And most of the governors are very happy."
1763,2020-04-05,"Now, a lot of times, you know, it's politics. Maybe I do the same thing, I don't know. But they'll try and act not so happy."
1764,2020-04-05,"I will tell you, when I speak to them or when the Vice President speaks to them, they're singing the praises of all of these people. So I always take umbrage when — when somebody says something about what we've done."
1765,2020-04-05,"Now, to do this — to do this should have taken —"
1766,2020-04-05,"To do what we've been able to do and to build it to a level, it should have taken a year. It should've taken two years. They did it in a matter of weeks. And we're helping states."
1767,2020-04-05,"No, it's them. As an example, New York had the right to buy 16,000 ventilators. They could have bought them. They didn't. I understand why they didn't. It was a very expensive purchase. You know, a very expensive — and that's a lot: 16,000. And they chose to do something else with their money. I understand that. The problem is when something like this comes along, which you don't expect."
1768,2020-04-05,"Look, 1917 — that's a long time ago — perhaps 100 million people died. That's a long time ago. So people don't think it's going to happen. I would have, frankly — I mean, did anybody in this room think a thing like this could happen? But it happened. And we built up a force. This is a military operation, as it turned out — it really is — with FEMA, with the Army Corps of Engineers."
1769,2020-04-05,"I mean, Army Corps of — and you were very gracious on that point. The Army Corps of Engineers is building 2,500 units of beds and everything else now. And then Governor Cuomo called and he wanted it to go COVID, meaning, for the problem. And we said, “Well, it wasn't supposed to be that way, but we want to get it done.” And we've moved military personnel, so now military personnel are operating it."
1770,2020-04-05,"And I'll tell you what's — what's good. It hasn't been very full. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. It hasn't been. Now, maybe over the next week, something will happen, but it hasn't been."
1771,2020-04-05,"But we have — because it's better than the other alternative where we run out. But they built actually 2,900 beds. And we have — also, we built four medical centers in New York. We've built four hospitals, four medical centers, and a lot more than that."
1772,2020-04-05,"It's such an honor to have done it. But the people that did it are amazing and they have to be appreciated by the states, not me. They don't have appreciate me at all. I don't care about me. They have to appreciate the generals, the admirals, the doctors, the nurses."
1773,2020-04-05,"I mean, we're bringing now 3,000 people in that are medical professionals that are coming from all over the country to help New York City, help New York State, and help many other places."
1774,2020-04-05,"I just think it's incredible what they've done, and I don't think that they've been appreciated. Me, you can forget about. Me, you can forget —"
1775,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Yeah, I rea- — I actually mean it. They have to be appreciated."
1776,2020-04-05,"Go in the back, please."
1777,2020-04-05,I do. I do.
1778,2020-04-05,I see light at the end of the tunnel.
1779,2020-04-05,"If I didn't, I would not be — I would not be very thrilled with what we've done. No, I see light at the end of the tunnel. I think indications are some of the numbers coming out today. I think, you know, we had a very good meeting today. We're seeing things that we don't even report because we think it's too early to report."
1780,2020-04-05,"No, I think, you know, we're seeing things happen that are very good. And we also know — all of us, including the medical professionals — that we have to open our country up. We have to get go- — we have to open our country up. No country was designed for this, where you close it. We're in the midst of the greatest economic boom in history for any country. Our country had the greatest economic boom in history. We had the most people working that we've ever had, almost 160 million people. And then from 160 million, they want nobody to leave the house."
1781,2020-04-05,"You know, you could use the term “cold turkey.” Right? That's called “cold turkey.” Countries are not designed — this country is not designed for that. We have to get our country back. And I think it's going to come back, and I hope it's going to come back very quickly."
1782,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Go ahead."
1783,2020-04-05,That's good.
1784,2020-04-05,"No, she feels that way."
1785,2020-04-05,"She feels that — I — I would wear one. I mean, I just — generally, I'm not in a — like, I should — would you like me to wear one right now and answer your question? That would be a little awkward, I guess."
1786,2020-04-05,"But, no, I mean — again, I would wear one if it was — if I thought it was important."
1787,2020-04-05,"She — she thinks — she likes the idea of wearing it, yeah. She does. A lot of people do. Again, it's a recommendation, and I understand that recommendation and I'm okay with it."
1788,2020-04-05,Wouldn't be surprised.
1789,2020-04-05,Sure. What would you like to know?
1790,2020-04-05,Sure. Doctor?
1791,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, he — he'd like to see the company [sic] open too. I mean, you know —"
1792,2020-04-05,He's called “an American who loves our country.”
1793,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1794,2020-04-05,And we've made great progress with the antibody testing. Fantastic progress.
1795,2020-04-05,Do you know how many times you've answered that question?
1796,2020-04-05,Maybe 15. Fifteen times. You don't have to ask the question.
1797,2020-04-05,He's answered that question 15 times.
1798,2020-04-05,Good.
1799,2020-04-05,"That's a very — a very good answer. All right, I think that really could be it. That was a very — I love that answer, especially on the facemask. I thought it was very good."
1800,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1801,2020-04-05,"Oh, stop it."
1802,2020-04-05,"Who are you with? By the way, who are you with?"
1803,2020-04-05,Who you with?
1804,2020-04-05,That's another beautiful — that's another beautiful (inaudible) —
1805,2020-04-05,"Are you ready? Are you ready? Let me just answer your question because I know exactly — you know, the same question you ask all the time. Ready?"
1806,2020-04-05,They have done an unbelievable job in delivering —
1807,2020-04-05,"For the Associated Press, which is, you know, not so great, not like it used to be."
1808,2020-04-05,"The people that you're looking at — FEMA, the military — what they've done is a miracle. What they've done is a miracle in getting all of this stuff. What they've done for states is incredible. And you should be thanking them for what they've done, not always asking wise-guy questions."
1809,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you."
1810,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Thank you very much. This week, America continues our aggressive effort to defeat the virus as we enter a crucial and difficult phase of the battle."
1811,2020-04-05,"We continue to send our prayers to the people of New York and New Jersey, and to our whole country. But right now, New York and New Jersey are very hot zones, and we're with them. We're with everybody. Your struggle is our struggle, and we will beat this virus. We will beat it together."
1812,2020-04-05,"I also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson. We're very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this afternoon, a little while ago, and Americans are all praying for his recovery. He's been a really good friend. He's been really something very special. Strong. Resolute. Doesn't quit. Doesn't give up."
1813,2020-04-05,"We have made tremendous progress on therapeutics. I had a fantastic call today, which I'll be talking about a little bit later. And I've asked two of the leading companies — these are brilliant companies. Ebola, AIDS, others. They've come with the solutions and just have done incredible jobs. And I've asked them to contact London immediately. They have offices in London. They're major companies. But more than major, more than size, they're genius."
1814,2020-04-05,"And I had a talk with four of them today. And they speak a language that most people don't even understand, but I understand something: that they've really advanced therapeutics and therapeutically, and they have arrived in London already. Their London office has whatever they need, and we'll see if we can be of help."
1815,2020-04-05,"We've contacted all of Boris's doctors, and we'll see what is going to take place. But they are ready to go. But when you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease."
1816,2020-04-05,"So, the two companies are there. And with what they are talking about — and it's rather complex and has had really incredible results — we're working with the FDA and everybody else, but we are working with London, with respect to Boris Johnson."
1817,2020-04-05,"Across the country, we're attacking the enemy on all fronts, including medical, scientific, social, logistical, and economic. We're pressing into action the full power of American government and American enterprise. And our military has been incredible. We've just sent 3,000 public health personnel. They're now deployed in the New York area, and they'll be over at the Javits Center, over at the great ship."
1818,2020-04-05,"And as you probably have heard — and I was informed that Governor Cuomo has already told you and announced — he called me up a little while ago, and he asked whether or not it would be possible to use the ship, with respect to fighting the virus. And we hadn't had that in mind at all, but we're going to let him do it, and we're also going to let New Jersey. Governor Murphy — we spoke with him a little while ago, and New Jersey is going to use it also because New Jersey is a hot — a hotspot."
1819,2020-04-05,"So Governor Murphy and Governor Cuomo are going to be using the ship for New York, New Jersey. And it's a big ship, and it's now COVID; it's set for COVID. And we are going to — hopefully that will be very helpful to both states. The Javits Center, which is 2,900 beds, just built by our military, also is going to be manned now by the military. And they should be in place tomorrow, and they'll start sending quite a few people over to the Javits Center. It's convenient. It's right in the middle of everything. So that'll be something great."
1820,2020-04-05,"And we appreciated Governor Cuomo's nice — really nice statements and, likewise, Governor Murphy. We have worked very well with both of them and with, frankly, all of the governors. Vice President Pence had a call this morning with them that lasted for close to two hours. And I understand there wasn't a negative person on the call. Fifty governors — or just about fifty governors — I think they were all on, from what I understood. And they were very positive about everything their federal government has been doing for them. And you'll hear what that is, and it's — it's rather amazing, actually."
1821,2020-04-05,"Nationwide, the Army Corps of Engineers is building 22 field hospitals — these are big hospitals — and alternate care sites in 18 states. So you have a combination of 22 field hospitals. In addition to that, we're building alternate care sites, which is a little bit of a smaller version of the hospital. And we have a lot of them, and they're going up in 18 different states."
1822,2020-04-05,"In total, we have deployed 8,450 hospital beds from federal stockpiles. And, you know, if you think, this is done over a period of — really, a period of weeks. It's incredible, actually. More than 8,000 ventilators have been sent from the National Stockpile to our cities and states, backed by the Defense Production Act, which we've used very strongly, very powerfully. So powerfully that we don't have to use it too much, frankly. And it's nice when you don't have to. We're getting more than we ever bargained for."
1823,2020-04-05,"American industry is stepping up. Manufacturers are really going to town. And we have thousands of ventilators being built as we speak, and we have hundreds that are being sent to different locations, and we're ready to roll with almost 10,000 that we have in the federal stockpile."
1824,2020-04-05,"When I say “ready to roll,” too, I mean exactly what that states: We are — wherever that monster goes, we're able to move with it. Great flexibility. We have tremendous flexibility. And we have people waiting, and they're ready, willing, and able, but waiting to bring them wherever it may be, if they need it. If they need it. It's possible that they won't be needed, that we're fully stocked, because numbers are coming in where, because of what the American people are doing, we're having fewer hospital visits. I think that could be the case in New York. It could be the case in a few other states. And fewer beds, fewer hospital visits mean fewer ventilators. So we'll see whether or not our original projections were right."
1825,2020-04-05,"But anyway, I had a very good talk with both governors, and I think they're very happy — extremely happy about the — what we're doing for them, and especially going all COVID. So that'll take place almost immediately."
1826,2020-04-05,"See? I told you. Mike is the greatest. Mike — and you have done a great job, Mike, and I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it."
1827,2020-04-05,So — and it's going up at a rapid rate. Nobody has done more testing.
1828,2020-04-05,"And one of the reasons why they say — and I think I can say this, Deborah, very strongly — but one of the reasons that we have more cases is we've done more testing. If I went to some of these countries that have, in my opinion, far more people than we do, that had the problem, and if we did the kind of testing proportionately that we're doing, they'd have many more cases than us. But we have more cases because we do much more testing."
1829,2020-04-05,"So when you do the testing, you have cases. Otherwise, you wouldn't know about the cases. People sit home; you don't know about it."
1830,2020-04-05,"But we have now done 1,790,000 tests nationwide. That's more than any other country in the world, hence we have more cases. And that number is growing by nearly 125,000 people per day. Think of that one. So it's growing by 125,000 people per day."
1831,2020-04-05,"I told you about South Korea. This is a, you know, vastly faster — and we also have, they say, the most accurate of tests."
1832,2020-04-05,"CVS is launching — and they've been great — two new drive-through testing sites in Atlanta, Georgia, and Providence, Rhode Island. And each location will be able to test up to 1,000 patients per day using the ultra-fast five-minute test developed by Abbott Labs. Now they're down to five minutes. They call it the “ultra-fast” and it's very accurate. Abbott Labs, I want to thank them. They've been fantastic."
1833,2020-04-05,"We're also speeding urgent economic relief to the American worker and families and the employers. As of today, tens of thousands of small businesses have applied for more than $40 billion in relief under the Paycheck Protection Program. You've all been reading about it. And it's really — I mean, it's only been going for a couple of days. It's really been performing well. A couple of little glitches — minor glitches that have already been taken care of, what they say."
1834,2020-04-05,These funds will result in nearly 2 million jobs being preserved. So we're taking care of our workers — small businesses and our workers.
1835,2020-04-05,"Nearly 3,000 lenders have already made loans under the program, and we're signing up additional lenders very quickly — rapidly."
1836,2020-04-05,"Community banks have been very responsive, and larger banks are also stepping up. If this — if we run out of funds — by the way, we're already preparing because it's going so fast for the small businesses and their employees — we'll ask Congress to refill it immediately. But the banks have been great. The big banks — the Bank of America was right up there at the beginning. JPMorgan Chase was — has been great. After the first day, they really — they really came through, and a lot of the big banks. But the community banks have been fantastic."
1837,2020-04-05,"As we announced last week, we are providing $100 billion in direct support for our hospitals. And the first tranche, $30 billion, will be distributed this week."
1838,2020-04-05,"So I want to — I want to say one other thing. Our farmers — we love our farmers — and, as you know, as of April 1st, the China trade deal — 250-billion-dollar — they purchased $250 billion from us, if not more. And of that, approximately $50 billion is expected to be with our farmers."
1839,2020-04-05,"So it kicked in as of April 1st, and we'll see how it goes. It seems like they're buying. So we'll let you know how that's going. But they're buying anywhere from $40- to $50 billion worth of our agricultural product. That should have a huge impact on our farmers — a tremendous impact on our farmers. But we're watching it very closely."
1840,2020-04-05,"To fight the medical war, we've mobilized the unbeatable — and it just — it is unbeatable — strength of American determination, ingenuity, and compassion. I got to see that when I spoke to the great science — because I call them “science companies” more than drug companies. They're scientists."
1841,2020-04-05,"We've seen businesses, charities, and private citizens making generous donations. So many people are making donations. We've seen states and cities supporting and helping each other and caring for our citizens. And we've seen Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs uniting together to answer the challenge and rise to the moment. And that's what they're doing."
1842,2020-04-05,"Above all, we have been awe-inspired by the exceptional courage of the doctors, nurses, EMTs, and healthcare workers who are the soldiers of this war. No words can ever express the complete measure of our gratitude for these intrepid heroes."
1843,2020-04-05,"One Cleveland patient credited his medical team for not only saving his life through their skill, but forever changing his life through their example of selfless devotion. Couldn't believe it — so generous he was with his statements. And he talked about their bravery in an area that was in such trouble — an area of that hospital where people were dying. And he talked about their bravery."
1844,2020-04-05,"Another survivor in Houston said simply, “I will consider them my angels forever.” “I will consider them” — think of that — “my angels forever.”"
1845,2020-04-05,"As our nation endures the depths of loss and grief, we are also witness to the summit of American virtue, character, and courage. With the love and dedication of every American patriot, we will win this battle, we will defeat this enemy, and we will rise from this present crisis with new strength, unity, and resolve. And that's what's happening."
1846,2020-04-05,"Tremendous stories are coming out of this horrible moment. A very dark moment for the world. One hundred and eighty two. I was saying 151 for a while, and then it got up to 160. And it's 182, as I announced yesterday. A hundred and eighty-two countries are being attacked by this virus."
1847,2020-04-05,"So I just want to thank everybody, and I want to thank the American citizens for doing a great job. Stay inside. And let's win this, and let's get our country open as soon as we can. I think it's going to be sooner than people think. Things are going really well. Again, light at the end of the tunnel."
1848,2020-04-05,"And with that, I'll take a few questions. And then Mike is going to take over and talk with the Admiral and with the professionals. And we appreciate you being here."
1849,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
1850,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1851,2020-04-05,"Well, it's a very — yeah, it's a very complex treatment of things that they've just recently developed and that they have a lot of experience with, having to do with something else, but recent for this. And they'll be — they've already concurred. They've already had meetings with the doctors. And we'll see whether or not they want to go that route."
1852,2020-04-05,"But when you're in intensive care, it's a big deal. So they're there and they're ready. I think we have — we have three of them. We have — I spoke with four. You know who the four would be. And you know the people within those — you probably — you'd know the companies if I told you the companies. But the people are the greatest — the greatest in the world."
1853,2020-04-05,"So they're at the hospital, and we'll see. And they have — they have everything with them, should it be needed. Hopefully — hopefully it won't have to be needed, but should it be needed."
1854,2020-04-05,"I just — I've found him — I've found Boris to be a fantastic person. Just, like, a fantastic warm, strong, smart guy. He loves his country. You see that. I mean, he fought like — like hell for his country. And intensive care is big stuff. Really big stuff."
1855,2020-04-05,"No, I don't think so. Mike had his test a couple of days ago. I had my test a couple of days ago. So — and we're here, and here you are. So, no, I don't think so. But I think we'll probably — just because of questions like that, I think we'll probably have maybe quite a few tests. It's not the worst idea."
1856,2020-04-05,"You know, the system of testing now is so quick and so easy. So, I could see —"
1857,2020-04-05,And you were tested again today?
1858,2020-04-05,You sure you're okay?
1859,2020-04-05,Good. Then I'm staying here.
1860,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1861,2020-04-05,"Well, it's just wrong."
1862,2020-04-05,It's just wrong. Did I hear the word “inspector general”? Really? It's wrong. And they'll talk to you about it. It's wrong.
1863,2020-04-05,"Uh, it's — well, where did he come from — the inspector general? What's his name?"
1864,2020-04-05,"No, what's his name? What's his name?"
1865,2020-04-05,"Well, find me his name. Let me know. Okay? If you find me his name, I'd appreciate it."
1866,2020-04-05,All I can tell you is this: We put up on the board —
1867,2020-04-05,You're going to ask — you're going to ask the Admiral. But we are doing —
1868,2020-04-05,Fine.
1869,2020-04-05,Then speak to the Admiral.
1870,2020-04-05,"But we've done more testing and had more results than any country, anywhere in the world. They're doing an incredible job. Now they're all calling us. They want our testing. “What are we doing?” “How do you do the five-minute test?” “How do you do the 15-minute test?”"
1871,2020-04-05,"So, give me the name of the inspector general. Could politics be entered into that?"
1872,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
1873,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1874,2020-04-05,"I don't like that decision, if that's — I don't — I didn't hear that that was his decision. I know that he stopped it for other countries. I spoke to him yesterday. We had a very good talk. And we'll see whether or not that is. I would be surprised if he would, you know, because India does very well with the United States. For many years, they've been taking advantage of the United States on trade. So I would be surprised if that were his decision. He'd have to tell me that."
1875,2020-04-05,"I spoke to him Sunday morning. I called him. And I said, “We'd appreciate your allowing our supply to come out.” If he doesn't allow it to come out, that would be okay, but, of course, there may be retaliation. Why wouldn't there be?"
1876,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
1877,2020-04-05,I don't think so. I think it's done very well.
1878,2020-04-05,"Not anymore, they haven't."
1879,2020-04-05,"Bank of America has been the leader, taking tremendous numbers of applications, and, of course, there may have been — they wanted to have a slightly different application, they wanted to have a little different information. But Bank of America has been a leader. They had number one in terms of applications."
1880,2020-04-05,"I wish you'd ask the question differently. Why don't you say, “It's gotten off to a tremendous start, but there are some little glitches” — which, by the way, have been worked out? It would be so much nicer if you'd do that. But you're just incapable of asking a question in a positive way."
1881,2020-04-05,It's already done. It's already done.
1882,2020-04-05,"It's taken the measures. It's taken the measures. And we may even do a different system. Not with this. We're going to have to probably add more money to this, to save — and to keep our small businesses going and to keep the employees of those small businesses working."
1883,2020-04-05,"But it's such a positive event and you ask it in such a negative way. It's just — I wish — I wish we had a fair media in this country, and we really don't."
1884,2020-04-05,"Speaking of unfair, go ahead."
1885,2020-04-05,"Well, I haven't heard it exactly. I haven't heard. I heard they had a statement that was made. If that were the statement — it's a strong statement."
1886,2020-04-05,"Look, the letters shouldn't have been sent, and certainly they shouldn't have been leaked. This is a military operation."
1887,2020-04-05,"I must tell you, I've heard very good things about the gentleman — both gentlemen, by the way — I will say this. But about both gentlemen. And I may look into it only from the standpoint that something should be resolved, because I'm hearing good things about both people."
1888,2020-04-05,"I may just get involved, if it's okay with you."
1889,2020-04-05,"Yeah, because, you know what? You have two good people and they're arguing. And I'm good, believe it or not, at settling arguments. I'm good at settling these arguments. So I may look into it in great detail — in detail. And I'll be able to figure it out very fast."
1890,2020-04-05,But that was a statement — and it's a rough statement. But look —
1891,2020-04-05,"Look — look, letters should not have been sent to many people, unclassified. That was a mistake. It's a mistake that shouldn't have been made, because it's unfair to the families of the people on the ship because they get nervous. And it shows weakness. And there's nothing weak about us now. Not anymore. We have the strongest military we've ever had. And we're not going to be showing weakness to anybody because we have — that ship is incredible — nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. And we don't want to be doing — writing letters. We don't want to have letter-writing campaigns where the fake news finds a letter or gets a leak. We don't want that."
1892,2020-04-05,"So, the letter —"
1893,2020-04-05,"Excuse me. So the letter shouldn't have been sent. With all of that said, his career prior to that was very good. So I'm going to get involved and see exactly what's going on there. Because I don't want to destroy somebody for having a bad day. Okay? Does that make sense?"
1894,2020-04-05,Okay.
1895,2020-04-05,He did.
1896,2020-04-05,"He did. We had a very good talk. We agreed that we weren't going to talk about what we said, but we had a very, very good talk. It was a warm talk. I enjoyed it. I hope he enjoyed it, too. And it was short. It was 15 minutes."
1897,2020-04-05,"Well, he had suggestions. It doesn't mean that I agree with those suggestions, but certainly he had suggestions. And I also told him some of the things we're doing. But the conversation was a friendly — very friendly conversation."
1898,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
1899,2020-04-05,It will be a difficult week and a half...
1900,2020-04-05,True.
1901,2020-04-05,"Well, if Dr. Fauci said that, I would be inclined to call them up. You know, we do have a constitutional problem in doing that. You understand that. I mean, there's a double — there's a double-edged sword. You understand. I can do it, but it is a constitutional — you can say federalist, you can say there's lots of different reasons, where I would rather have the governors do it, make their own determination."
1902,2020-04-05,"They're smaller — and not in all cases but, sort of, they're smaller cases. But I'm not sure 100 percent that Dr. Fauci said that, but you can ask him."
1903,2020-04-05,"Tony, you want to say something? Please."
1904,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1905,2020-04-05,"I think that with the therapies and I think that with the vaccines, which I have total confidence are coming — and I'm dealing with the companies. I'm talking to Johnson &amp; Johnson, I'm talking to all of them."
1906,2020-04-05,"I think that when you add the tremendous stimulus that we're giving — like, for instance, deductibility for restaurant expenses, for restaurants and entertainment; the money that we're talking about for small businesses and employees to keep everybody working; and other things that we're, frankly, working on right now, which are going to be great for our people — I think when you add that to it, I think we can get more than back to normal, from an economic standpoint. It would actually be better. But more than back to normal."
1907,2020-04-05,"But I — I would agree that we'd love to see a vaccine, but immediately, we'd love to see a therapeutic. And I think we're getting very close."
1908,2020-04-05,"I don't want to comment on that, but I can tell you that we certainly want to try. We certainly want to see what — what's going on. We're doing very well. Look, if you look at those, you look at most places where that — you can call it the “bump.” You could call it the “hill”. You can call it the “mountain.” You can call it — whatever you want to do it. It's very flat. You take a look. And that was done through mitigation. That was done through a lot of good work."
1909,2020-04-05,"And that far exceeded our expectations before. I mean, you — people can't even believe how — how low some of those bumps are, some of those hills are. They're very surprised. They have a couple of tough ones. New Jersey has been very tough and New York has been very tough. They're crowded in. You know, it's tight, it's tougher. But far exceeding. California far exceeds; Washington State far exceeds."
1910,2020-04-05,"You look at so many of these states, how well they're doing. The eight states, by the way — and I haven't spoken to the governors, but Tony is so right: They may not have it from the standpoint that they're saying it, but those people are practicing it and they're doing a fantastic job. Take a look at where they are, in terms of the levels. But take a look where they are."
1911,2020-04-05,"So — but if I thought it was something that — and I've looked at them, and I've looked at them very carefully. I looked at them today, looked at them yesterday. From a constitutional standpoint, I'd love not to get involved with that. And not from a legal standpoint, just from a moral, constitutional standpoint. Because legally, I can, but morally, I — you know, I believe in our Constitution, much more so than most people."
1912,2020-04-05,"And I'd love to be able to let the governors do what they have to do. Those states are doing a fantastic job, all eight of them. They're doing a fantastic job. So we'll see what happens."
1913,2020-04-05,"As for your question, you fully understand what I'm saying, so thank you."
1914,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
1915,2020-04-05,"Well, I think Boris was looking at it differently. He was looking at it earlier. He was looking at it like “ride it out.” There were many people thinking about riding it out, meaning, you know, whatever it is, it is."
1916,2020-04-05,"But then you see what starts to happen and the numbers become monumental, and they decide not to do that. We actually moved early. We moved early because of what we did with respect to the ban on China coming in and then Europe coming in. That was an early ban too. And then UK."
1917,2020-04-05,"So, no, he — he waited a little while, and he — he felt that, but he got — you know, he made a decision very quickly thereafter to do what they did. And they they — they've gone to a very strict lockdown. But they're suffering greatly as a nation right now. They're going through a lot. You know, they're — they're a nation that's having a difficult time."
1918,2020-04-05,"But I've gotten to know him. He's just such an incredible guy. It was just so shocking to see that because you know what that means. Intensive care is a big deal with regard to what we're talking about. That's a very big deal, a very scary deal."
1919,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
1920,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I could get you that information. I think they'd — I think they'd probably be willing to give that. Right?"
1921,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we could get you that information."
1922,2020-04-05,"Jeff, please?"
1923,2020-04-05,Yeah.
1924,2020-04-05,"Well, you're the first one that's told me that. I don't know. We'll have to make that decision. And maybe we will, maybe we won't. But we'll have to make that decision."
1925,2020-04-05,"I think the cuts are automatic. If you're a believer in markets, I can guarantee you there's a cut from pre this condition."
1926,2020-04-05,"You know, look, this happened because of the virus. The virus knocked out 40 percent. It was — it went down in one hour. I mean, literally, when places close up, you're talking about a 40 percent cut."
1927,2020-04-05,"No, I think it's happening automatically, but nobody has asked me that question yet, so we'll see what happens. I'll —"
1928,2020-04-05,I'll let you know Thursday evening.
1929,2020-04-05,Okay.
1930,2020-04-05,"Well, I think it's automatic because they're already cutting. I mean, if you look, they're cutting back."
1931,2020-04-05,"Because it's — its market, it's demand. It's supply and demand. They're already cutting back, and they're cutting back very seriously."
1932,2020-04-05,"Well, nobody has asked me that. So, if they ask me, I'll make a decision. Okay? But I'll — but again, it's happening anyway."
1933,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
1934,2020-04-05,"Yeah, so I had a physical. The first half was very successful. I did it on a day when I was in the White House and we were able to do that, as the doctor reported. And I have some — the second half of the physical different. Probably is done at Walter Reed, and I'll do that at the appropriate time, but I feel very good. And according to the doctor, very good shape."
1935,2020-04-05,I told you. I told you. He understood very well. I appreciate your understanding.
1936,2020-04-05,"It's called the Constitution of the United States. And I'd rather have, if possible, for the governors to make the decision. If a decision was very necessary — and they have done a good job. And Tony said it better than anybody. They are — they are doing — they are doing what we're asking them to do without having to put the seal on it."
1937,2020-04-05,"But I will say, if I thought it was necessary, I'll do it in a heartbeat."
1938,2020-04-05,Opening what?
1939,2020-04-05,"I haven't seen — I'm going to have to see to what extent. I'm going to have to see how many people you're talking about, are they crowded, are they packed, are they not packed. We'll have to take a look at it. Right now, it's very early for beaches in Georgia. So, right now, very early. So I'll take a look at it."
1940,2020-04-05,"He's done a very good job as the governor. He knows what he's doing, but we'll have to take a look. It really does depend on, you know, how crowded it may be. But I will talk to him and I will ask him that question. I would ask him."
1941,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
1942,2020-04-05,"We're looking at it. And the airlines have been cutting their routes. You saw that yesterday. They announced big cuts in routes. We need some — some flights for emergency use for military people. We need some flights for medical people. And they are very few flights, as you know. And the flights that are going out are — I think they said they're 3 to 4 percent full. You have 3 percent of the plane is occupied. So it's — they're very, very — generally, very, very empty planes."
1943,2020-04-05,"But it's good to have — it's a — it's a tiny amount of flights, relative to the overall."
1944,2020-04-05,"And we need them also for medical workers, for — otherwise, we're going to have to do a whole big thing with our own planes. So they're done for a reason. There's also testing done when people get onto those planes and also when people get off the planes."
1945,2020-04-05,"Well, it still could be her opinion. But when was she appointed? When was she appointed?"
1946,2020-04-05,Would you do me a favor? Let me know.
1947,2020-04-05,"No, no, let me know now. I have to know now, Jon. Let me know now."
1948,2020-04-05,"Because we are doing an incredible job of testing. We are doing a better job than anybody in the world right now on testing. There's nobody close. And other nations admit this. Other nations have admitted it very strongly. Other nations are calling us, wanting to know about our testing. Let me know when she was appointed, would you?"
1949,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
1950,2020-04-05,"Okay, thank you very much. Go ahead, please."
1951,2020-04-05,Yes.
1952,2020-04-05,Right. People I know very well.
1953,2020-04-05,Sounds like a statement more than a question.
1954,2020-04-05,We just signed a trade deal.
1955,2020-04-05,"It's the biggest deal probably ever made. And I hope they're going to honor that trade deal. If they don't honor the trade deal, then I'll tell you a different answer, but I think they will. They're going to spend billions of dollars for agriculture. They're going to spend billions of dollars for many different things."
1956,2020-04-05,Whereas China never spent money in our country —
1957,2020-04-05,"— we spent money. We had a deficit — a trade deficit — with China for years of $500 billion, $400 billion. We had the biggest trade deficits in the history of the world with China. Now China is going to spend a lot — has agreed to spend $250 billion — many billions of dollars in our country, much of it going to farmers and manufacturers."
1958,2020-04-05,"So, I'll let you know. I mean, I hope they're going to honor the deal. We'll find out."
1959,2020-04-05,I don't know. Who are you working for? China? You work for China or are you with a newspaper?
1960,2020-04-05,Who are you with?
1961,2020-04-05,Who owns that? China? Is it owned by China?
1962,2020-04-05,"No, is it owned by the state?"
1963,2020-04-05,"Okay, good. Okay."
1964,2020-04-05,"Look, I'll let you know. I'll give you a good answer to that in a few months. I want to just see what they do because it's time for them to help us. Okay? It's time right now for China to help us, and hopefully they do. And if they don't, that's okay too."
1965,2020-04-05,"But we signed a deal. It was signed in — with great goodwill and spirit. And it's time that our farmers benefitted, our manufacturers benefitted, and we'll see whether or not that deal is honored. And I think it will be because I know President Xi, who I like and respect. And I think he will honor the deal he made with us."
1966,2020-04-05,"It just went into effect four days ago. I will see whether or not. In fact, I called up just a little while ago. I said, “How are the farmers doing with respect to China? Are they buying the product as anticipated?” And the answer was, “Yeah, I think so.” But it wasn't the most positive, but it was — it was starting. It was starting. The deal just started."
1967,2020-04-05,"So I'll let you know. But, you know, for many, many years, China ate our lunch because we had people in this position that I'm in right now that allowed China to get away with absolute murder, and it should have never happened."
1968,2020-04-05,But we are — we are now dealing with China. We'll see what happens.
1969,2020-04-05,Yeah. Go ahead.
1970,2020-04-05,Wait. Wait.
1971,2020-04-05,How many do you want to ask? How many do you want to ask?
1972,2020-04-05,Good.
1973,2020-04-05,Okay. We're going to take a look at it.
1974,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
1975,2020-04-05,Don't — don't interrupt. He's — he's talking.
1976,2020-04-05,"I can't tell you, but I know it goes out very quickly once the loan application is approved. And the process is very fast. And you have to understand: These are banks, and that's what they do. But they were swamped. They were actually swamped."
1977,2020-04-05,"Okay, go ahead. Please."
1978,2020-04-05,"Put the — put the slide up again, please. Just put it up."
1979,2020-04-05,Are you ready? Are you ready? Hospitals can do their own testing also. States can do their own testing. States are supposed to be doing testing. Hospitals are supposed to be doing testing. Do you understand that?
1980,2020-04-05,We're the federal government. Listen —
1981,2020-04-05,"We're the federal government. We're not supposed to stand on street corners doing testing. They go to doctors. They go to hospitals. They go to the state. The state is a more localized government; you have 50 of them. And they can go — 50 within here; you also have territories, as you know. And they do the testing."
1982,2020-04-05,"And if you look at the chart, if you take a look — did they put it up? Yeah. Just take a look. And these are testing and the results are now coming in very quickly."
1983,2020-04-05,"Initially speaking, the tests were old, obsolete, and not really prepared. We have a brand-new testing system that we developed very quickly, and that's your result. And you should say, “Congratulations. Great job” — instead of being so horrid in the way you ask a question."
1984,2020-04-05,Please. Go ahead.
1985,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I'd love to have the Admiral speak to that question. Yes. That's a great idea."
1986,2020-04-05,He's the one in charge.
1987,2020-04-05,How long has that person been in government? Could I ask you that?
1988,2020-04-05,"Oh, you didn't tell me that. Oh, I see. You didn't tell me that, Jon."
1989,2020-04-05,You didn't tell me that. Did serve in the previous admin- — you mean the Obama administration. Thank you for telling me that.
1990,2020-04-05,"See, there's a typical fake-news deal."
1991,2020-04-05,"No, look. Look —"
1992,2020-04-05,You're a third-rate reporter. And what you just said is a disgrace. Okay?
1993,2020-04-05,"You asked me — you said, “Sir, just got appointed.” Take a look at what you said."
1994,2020-04-05,"Now, I said, “When did they — when did this person — how long in government?”"
1995,2020-04-05,"“Well, it was appointed in the Obama administration.”"
1996,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, Jon. Thank you very much. You will never make it."
1997,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
1998,2020-04-05,"Boy, that's a terrible thing."
1999,2020-04-05,"It's about 9,000, just so you understand. It's about 9,000."
2000,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, you didn't tell me also that this inspector general came out of the Obama administration. You didn't tell me that either."
2001,2020-04-05,"Okay, please go ahead."
2002,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
2003,2020-04-05,"No, I understood his views before the call."
2004,2020-04-05,"I just think he's a very nice — I think he's a nice man. I've always thought he was a nice man. I've — I don't know him. I don't know if I ever spoke to him before, other than to say hello. But I think he's a nice man. We had a very nice call."
2005,2020-04-05,"No, but we may — no. Not really. We may — we're doing a great job."
2006,2020-04-05,"Hey, I inherited — we, this administration — we inherited a broken system, both militarily, but we've rebuilt our military where we now have so much ammunition, whereas you remember a very important general said, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” They wanted to save money on ammunition."
2007,2020-04-05,"They didn't want to save money because they spent money like nobody ever spent money. But you know what? We now have a great military rebuilt. And we have so much ammunition, we don't know what to do with it. Okay? And that's a nice feeling to have."
2008,2020-04-05,But they also gave us empty cupboards. The cupboard was bare. You've heard the expression: “The cupboard was bare.” So we took over a stockpile where the cupboard was bare and where the testing system was broken and old. And we redid it.
2009,2020-04-05,"And, frankly, it would be okay for a small event but not for a big event. And they had a chance to do it. Somebody said that a certain person — I won't tell you, but a certain person said this will happen. And that's true. The problem is that person never did anything about it — previous administrations. In previous admin- — they never did anything about it."
2010,2020-04-05,"You know, we all know all about pandemics and all of the things that we're seeing now, but nobody thought it was going to happen. And if we did think it was going to happen, the problem is nobody did anything about it."
2011,2020-04-05,"We did. We have rebuilt the system. And now we're a fine-tuned machine. We built thousands of hotel beds for New York. We moved a ship in that now we're going to make for COVID — COVID-19. We are going to make it so that people having this horrible thing happen to them will be able to use the ship. The ship, as I said, is going to be shared with New Jersey — New York and New Jersey."
2012,2020-04-05,"We've done things that are incredible. When you build — what was it? Eighteen hospitals. We built 18 hospitals. We built medical centers all over the country. And when you have Gavin Newsom and other governors who really have been very nice and generous in their statements — because they make the statements to the press, not just to my face. Others tell us how great we're doing — like the call that Mike had today. I heard from other people that were on the call; they said it was incredible. It was two hours, and it was — everything was positive. They were so happy with what we've done."
2013,2020-04-05,"And we're ready to do more if they need it, because we're ready to march. The Admiral can tell you: We are sitting there with 9,000 ventilators and we're ready to march when we see that. We can move quickly. As soon as we see that need, we can move very quickly. We're ready to march. We built a great system."
2014,2020-04-05,"The problem is, the Democrats — like a guy like Chuck Schumer, who's a total lightweight, by the way; I've known him for a long time. He'll say, “Why don't you put a military man in charge?” A military man? I have all military men. This man is doing an incredible job. We have two admirals, numerous generals. We have the Army Corps of Engineers. We have FEMA. We have this whole force that like nobody has ever seen before. We have a great military operation and they've done an incredible job."
2015,2020-04-05,"And honestly, people should respect — because nobody has ever seen anything like what we've done. And what they end up — what — forget about me; don't worry about me. I get — I will only get bad — if I say, “How many ventilators do you need, Governor?” “A thousand would be great.” I said “Nope, I'm going to send you 10,000.” And then you'll call up from the media. You'll say, “How did Trump do?” “We're not happy. He didn't send us enough ventilators.” Because that's called politics."
2016,2020-04-05,"But if you look at what's happening, that — and I'm even surprised. The governors are saying all good things. But the Democrat governors, and a couple of RINOs — frankly, they're RINOs. It's all they are — one RINO, in particular. But the governors are saying great things."
2017,2020-04-05,"He had a call that lasted two hours today. I heard about the call, not just from Mike. It was a perfect call. Now I'm sure you were on the call, even though you're not supposed to be. I'm sure you were on the call — meaning some of the media was on the call, because they're constantly reporting the call. If they're honest, they will say it was a great call."
2018,2020-04-05,"Okay. Okay. Next question, please."
2019,2020-04-05,Here we go. Here we go.
2020,2020-04-05,We're never going to do anything that hurts Texas.
2021,2020-04-05,We're only — we're only helping Texas.
2022,2020-04-05,"By the way, the governor is doing a great job over there with the situation."
2023,2020-04-05,"And Texas is so big, you have some parts of the state that are affected, other parts that aren't affected at all. You know, it's an incredible place."
2024,2020-04-05,"No, we're going to use whatever we need, and we're doing it totally in conjunction with the governor. Okay? We're doing it in conjunction with your Texas governor, who's done a fantastic job. Great."
2025,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2026,2020-04-05,Very few people are coming through our border. And you'll be happy to know we're up to mile 161 of the wall.
2027,2020-04-05,"Oh, I see. Okay."
2028,2020-04-05,"But on the border between Mexico, we have 161 miles of wall."
2029,2020-04-05,"Okay, good."
2030,2020-04-05,"Well, I mean, look, you — first, you want us to call eight governors and tell them to do something. And then you're complaining that another governor is so strict that he actually checks the borders. I understand why he's doing that: because he knows who he has and he doesn't want people coming in if they should maybe, you know, not be to — to the liking of the doctors."
2031,2020-04-05,"No, I think it's — look, he's done a great job. He's done a great job with this case, as have many other governors. But he's done a great job."
2032,2020-04-05,"One of the things I thought you were going to say is we've been very tough on our southern border, as you know. Very very tough."
2033,2020-04-05,"And part of that is because of the fact that we have so much — you know, when you talk about 160 miles of new wall, nobody is coming through that. Nobody. Not even close. And we're building it rapidly. We will have — early next year, we'll have close to 500 miles of wall, which is what our goal was."
2034,2020-04-05,Please go ahead.
2035,2020-04-05,"I don't know necessarily, but I certainly want to listen. And what I want to do is two things: a real infrastructure, not a Green New Deal. You know, the carbon footprint. I'm not looking for the carbon footprint. We want to put people to work."
2036,2020-04-05,"But a real — and, frankly, for so many years, we've let our infrastructure go to hell because we were wasting all our money in the Middle East and other places. Okay? I want to rebuild our country. I don't want to rebuild — we're tired. We've built — we've rebuilt, if you call it that — or destroyed, frankly. What we've done is so crazy. What we have done — the direction that this country has taken is so sad."
2037,2020-04-05,"But we're in the Middle East for $8 trillion. And if you want to fix a pothole in a highway, you can't do it because they don't want to give you the funds. So we want to have an infrastructure bill — a real one, like in the vicinity of $2 trillion — to completely rebuild our roads, our bridges, our highways, our tunnels, everything. And I'm totally open to listening to that."
2038,2020-04-05,I'm also open to listening to and even putting forward — because we're going to be putting something forward — more money for our citizens because they've gone through trauma. This has been trauma. This came out of nowhere.
2039,2020-04-05,"When — and I say it and I'll say it again: We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had the most people working in the history of our country, almost 160 million people — far more than ever before."
2040,2020-04-05,"And then one day, our professionals correctly came to us and they said, “Sorry, sir, we have to close down our country.” And I said, “Say it again. Say it again.” “We have to close down our country.” And the entire world closed down because of this hidden enemy."
2041,2020-04-05,"No, we — we are going to take good care of our people. It was not their fault."
2042,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. Yes, please."
2043,2020-04-05,Deborah?
2044,2020-04-05,So you did not get there? You did not get there?
2045,2020-04-05,"Good, I'm very happy about that."
2046,2020-04-05,(Inaudible.)
2047,2020-04-05,Your grandson is okay?
2048,2020-04-05,"That's a lot of temperature, 105."
2049,2020-04-05,That's a lot of temperature.
2050,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Deborah."
2051,2020-04-05,"And it is making a big difference. I saw where Governor Cuomo was a little bit upset today. Over the weekend, a lot of people outside and they were — they were pretty big groups of people. I saw that. I noticed that. And he wasn't happy with that. And I could understand that."
2052,2020-04-05,"Look, we have a period — a short period of time –hopefully, it's a short period of time to go. And let's get it done. Let's get it done."
2053,2020-04-05,"Kristen, did you have a question?"
2054,2020-04-05,You're so quiet today.
2055,2020-04-05,"It's because you have your own show now, right?"
2056,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2057,2020-04-05,"Well, I was opposed to the way of distribution — money distribution — through, as you know, unemployment and through the state offices because they have very old com- — not all of them, but many of them — have 40- year-old equipment, as I've said. And it makes it very difficult."
2058,2020-04-05,"But that's what they're looking — that's what they to do. That's the way it's mandated to do. I thought it would be better if we did a direct payment system, but the Democrats really wanted it. And I think they had some — some help from a couple of people that I would have — had I spoken to them, I would have convinced them otherwise, I really believe."
2059,2020-04-05,"But, so — but it's getting out. And the federal government has done its job. All we can do is give this massive amount of money to the states. The states then are responsible to distribute it — a little bit like we're talking about here. But the money will be right on time from the federal government, then the states have to do their job in getting it out."
2060,2020-04-05,We could very well do a second round of direct. I would do it direct.
2061,2020-04-05,It's under — it is absolutely under serious consideration.
2062,2020-04-05,"Well, we have people that are so talented."
2063,2020-04-05,I know the people he suggested. They're wonderful people. They worked here. They're wonderful people.
2064,2020-04-05,He's just doing that because it's politics. Because you know what?
2065,2020-04-05,"We have many. Depending on what? In terms of testing, this gentlemen right here."
2066,2020-04-05,"In terms — you know who the point person is? This gentleman right here. He's the one in charge of the task force. But, Mike, you may want to tell him about the — because this is really a military operation."
2067,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Mike."
2068,2020-04-05,"And, Kristen, when Schumer makes a statement like that, he's only doing it for politics. He knows. We have the best generals, the best admirals. We have the best people. These are incredible leaders. These are vibrant people. They've done such a good job."
2069,2020-04-05,"And again, you'll get a tape of the conversation because I'm sure some of the governors probably had their favorite reporter listening to the conversation, even though they weren't supposed to. But that's happened before."
2070,2020-04-05,"Just so you understand, we had a call today that was a beautiful call — everybody friendly, everybody happy. They also know, in some cases, we'll get them a little bit more. And if they need it, we'll get them a lot more, depending on where this monster is going."
2071,2020-04-05,"But when Schumer does that, take a look — take a look at the past —"
2072,2020-04-05,"Well, you know, you're going to have to tell me who."
2073,2020-04-05,"They certainly don't — well, yeah, some Democrats, because they view this as a campaign issue, they want to make Trump look as bad as they can because they want to try and win an election that they shouldn't be allowed to win, based on the fact that we have done a great job."
2074,2020-04-05,"We built the greatest economy in the world. I'll do it a second time. We got artificially stopped by a virus that nobody ever thought possible. And we've handled it, and we've built a team, and we've built an apparatus that's been unbelievable."
2075,2020-04-05,"Take a look at the swine flu. Right? That's H1N1. Take a look at that. And it's not the other way around, by the way. It's H1N1. Take a look — you know what I mean by that. Take a look at the swine flu. It was a disaster; 17,000 people died. The other administra- — they didn't even know — it was like they didn't even know it was here. And that was peanuts compared to what we have, in terms of the power, the magnitude of what we're going through. This is attacking 182 countries, simultaneously."
2076,2020-04-05,"So Schumer is just all about politics. I've known him almost all of my adult life. And he's — he's a disgrace. In many ways, he's a disgrace. And he knows it's (inaudible). He just wants to do that. But he knows the job we're doing."
2077,2020-04-05,"Everybody is amazed at the job we're doing. And the public is starting to find out. They're starting — you know, one of the reasons I do these news conferences — because if I didn't, they would believe fake news. And we can't let them believe fake news. They see us up here. They see us with admirals. They see us with this talent. They see the job that Mike Pence has done, which has been an unbelievable job. An unbelievable job."
2078,2020-04-05,"I put him there. I thought he'd do well. He did great as the governor of Indiana, and I thought Mike would do well. He's done much better than well. And he gets along with people, I think, much better than I do. Because I like people being 100 — Mike can put up with things that — sometimes I say, “It's amazing that he can put up with it.” But he's done an incredible job and so has the entire team."
2079,2020-04-05,"This is a military operation. And again, we built 2,900 beds in Javits Center. We — we built medical centers in New York. In Chicago, we built 1,000 beds — much more now — in McCormick Place. That's their big convention hall, the equivalent of Javits convention hall. Big McCormick Place. Fantastic place."
2080,2020-04-05,"By the way, the mayor of Chicago — at least on the phone — is extremely happy with what we're doing. She's thanking us. Has a great relationship with Mike. Thanking us."
2081,2020-04-05,And I just wish the politicians would say to you what they say to us. Really. And it's a good question.
2082,2020-04-05,"Do you have one? Yeah, please. And we'll get to you."
2083,2020-04-05,You said Latin America?
2084,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2085,2020-04-05,"Yeah. It's a good question. We've moved a tremendous number of boats and ships to the area of — you know, different areas of exactly where you're talking about — because we are tired of drugs pouring into our country from other places. And we're tired of seeing drugs pouring into different parts of Latin America, South America, and just coming into our country."
2086,2020-04-05,"Now we've got them stopped at the border and they're trying to do it by sea. So we stop them at the border with — and, frankly, with the help of Mexico. Mexico, right now, has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. They never had any soldiers. They're doing that because I've asked them to do it. That's the only reason they're doing it. They have 27,000 soldiers."
2087,2020-04-05,"So now they're trying to bring it in by boat and by ship — the drug lords and the people doing drugs — and trying to destroy our country from inside with drugs. And we're hitting them very, very hard. And that's why we're doing that."
2088,2020-04-05,Say it?
2089,2020-04-05,"Well, there are — there are the activities of human trafficking, and especially with respect to women. And, as you know, proportionally, it's mostly women."
2090,2020-04-05,And it's a horrible thing. It's a horrible thing.
2091,2020-04-05,"And there's never been a time like it. And it's because of the Internet. And this is all over the world. But, for the most part, they're coming through — in this country, they're coming through the southern border. But we're hitting them very hard. They have tremendous illegal trafficking in women — and children also, but mostly in women. And it's illegal. And it's horrible. And it's disgraceful. And I've seen things that are an absolute disgrace. And we're trying to knock them out, and we're knocking them hard."
2092,2020-04-05,"And again, I want to thank the President of Mexico because he has really stepped up to the plate. Twenty-seven thousand soldiers. They've never had any soldiers on our border. And I did that because the Democrats will not approve anything to stop — because they want to have open borders. They want to have all these people flowing through our border. And, in many cases, they're sick. They have problems that we — you don't want to know about. Or they're criminals, in many cases. Not in all cases, but in many cases. And they don't want to have bor- — they want to have open borders. They want to have sanctuary cities. So they protect criminals. And I don't want to have it."
2093,2020-04-05,"And Joe Biden does want to have that also, as you know, because he said that during numerous debates."
2094,2020-04-05,"I want to have strong borders, and I don't like protecting criminals with sanctuary cities. But we're doing it for drugs. We're doing it for human trafficking. We're doing it because you have to do it. We either have borders or we don't have a country."
2095,2020-04-05,"All right. Go ahead, please."
2096,2020-04-05,"Okay. I mean, I have an answer, but I'd rather have the Admiral answer that."
2097,2020-04-05,"Which nobody else can do, by the way. No other country can do it."
2098,2020-04-05,"Jeff, go ahead."
2099,2020-04-05,A few more. We'll do a few more.
2100,2020-04-05,"And then Mike is taking over, and you're going to see some incredible work that's been done."
2101,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
2102,2020-04-05,Yes.
2103,2020-04-05,He had a bad day or a bad — bad week.
2104,2020-04-05,"But I — I don't — yeah, I want to — I'm going to look into it."
2105,2020-04-05,"And I also — I also think our Navy Secretary — he's a highly respected man. So sometimes that happens with people, and I'll — I'll take a look at it."
2106,2020-04-05,"He had a bad day. When he sends a letter out and he sends copies all over the place and it's not a classified letter. And it was very disconcerting to the families of the people on the ship — were very disconcerting. So, number one, they get worried and scared. It was weak. We don't want weak."
2107,2020-04-05,"But I'm going to take a look because he's — I think he — you know, looks to me like he's an outstanding guy. I looked — I looked at his whole — just a little while ago, I looked at his file. And people have bad days and we'll take a look at it."
2108,2020-04-05,"Well, we'll take a look. I want to look, I want to speak also to the Secretary. I also want to speak to the Secretary of Defense, who is Mark Esper, who is doing a fantastic job. And we'll — you know, maybe I can help the situation out."
2109,2020-04-05,"I mean, you guys are saying, “Why is the President getting involved and going...” Well, I like to solve problems. It's a problem. You know? I — I don't want to see men hurt, women hurt. I don't want to see people hurt unnecessarily. Maybe we can solve it easily where, you know, it's not life changing."
2110,2020-04-05,"But he did — he did a bad thing, sending a letter out and many, many copies, as you know. I don't know, I heard 28 copies. I heard a lot. That's a lot of copies. Plus, the letter was five pages long. I haven't read the letter, but I think it was five pages long, single spaced. That's a lot of writing."
2111,2020-04-05,"You know, he's the captain of a ship. He's the — he's a very important person of a very expensive ship, a nuclear-powered ship. He shouldn't be writing letters like that. But it happens. Sometimes, I'll write a letter that I say, “I wish I didn't send it.” Not too often, but it happens."
2112,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead."
2113,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know want to comment on what he said. I — I understand."
2114,2020-04-05,"It's — it's tough language, but I don't want to — let's not get into that. It's tough language. Now, there are some people that think, “Oh, wow, he says it like it is.”"
2115,2020-04-05,"Look, he made a mistake. He should not have sent that letter or he should have gone through his chain of command, which is the typical way of doing it. You know, he's in the military. He's a very important person in the military. He knows it better than anybody in this room what he should have done and I'm sure he feels he made a mistake."
2116,2020-04-05,"But I'm going to look into it, and I'm going to see — maybe we can do something, because I'm not looking to destroy a person's life who's had an otherwise stellar career, as I understand it. I looked at his file just now because I've been seeing what's going on."
2117,2020-04-05,"If we can save — if we can save a person's career — I don't mind going after a person if they did something wrong. And, you know — but this was a mistake. He made a mistake. I'm not justifying what he did. He made a mistake. He shouldn't be sending letters. He's the captain. He's a very important person in the military. You don't send letters and then it leaks into a newspaper. Of all newspapers, that was a beauty. Right? So you just don't do that. So, it was a mistake."
2118,2020-04-05,But I may get involved. I'll call Secretary of Defense and find out a little bit about it. And if I can help two people — two good people — I'm going to help them.
2119,2020-04-05,Say it?
2120,2020-04-05,On the captain?
2121,2020-04-05,"No, it hasn't. I mean, look —"
2122,2020-04-05,"Okay, ready? I — I said — when you asked me and when the question was asked the last time, I said, “Shouldn't have sent the letter.” I haven't changed. He shouldn't have sent the letter. And it should've — if there's a letter, it should go classified and it should go to his superior. And he shouldn't be jumping over his superior."
2123,2020-04-05,"So, I'm — it hasn't changed, in that regard. The only thing that has played right up here with me is that I looked at his record. And he's been an outstanding person. If he wasn't, I wouldn't even be talking about this. He's been an outstanding person. He's had a very exemplary military career."
2124,2020-04-05,"I mean, you know, he started off as a helicopter pilot. They called him “Chopper.” His name was “Chopper.” He was a great helicopter pilot. It's a tremendous skill. I know a lot about helicopters. And then he went to F-16s or F-18s, and he was a tremendous pilot. And then — he's very smart. He studied nuclear energy and he was fantastic — and very few people have the aptitude, they have the mentality to do that. Nuclear energy is very complex. Very — it's very hard. Very few people can do it. And he did it well."
2125,2020-04-05,"And then he became the captain of a nuclear ship. Right? He became — of a — a replacement costs — if you look at replacement costs: $18 billion of replacement cost. Right? So he's got — on a replacement-cost basis, an $18 billion ship. You know, the President Gerald Ford — very expensive. That's, you know, the nearest thing I can think of. But they're spending money on that one like nobody's ever seen."
2126,2020-04-05,"So, he made a mistake. He made a mistake. And maybe we're going to make that mistake not destroy his life."
2127,2020-04-05,"Okay, a couple of more. A couple of more. Go ahead."
2128,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2129,2020-04-05,I know.
2130,2020-04-05,Very much on my mind.
2131,2020-04-05,"It doesn't have to be phase four. I think it could be a separate phase when it's all over. Right now, I don't think they want to think about it. These people don't want to think about it. These people are incredible. They're not thinking about, “How much am I getting paid?” These people are incredible. I've seen it. I see the spirit. I hear about it all the time from Mike, from the Admiral. I hear about it all the time. These people are incredible."
2132,2020-04-05,"When it's all over, I do want to seriously think — maybe in the form of bonuses. These people are — what they've done is incredible."
2133,2020-04-05,"I just — I just admire the attitude and I've said it. I just — they walk into those hospitals and they are seriously — you know, one of the things that came up with the Comfort, the ship, is that when we — we fulfilled the request of Governor Cuomo and Governor Murphy — and they're going to be splitting it. But, you know, a lot of the things happen to ships when you do the — you know, it's a lot of — they didn't want to do this. In fact, they specifically didn't want to do this: have patients that were affected with this horrible disease or whatever — the plague — because, frankly, it's a plague. That's exactly what it is. You'd read about it in the old days. The plague. And that's exactly what it is."
2134,2020-04-05,"But we're doing it. But when I see the bravery of these people walking through doors without their stuff — I mean, they're half — they're just getting — they're not standing outside, “Hey let's get ready. Let's...” They're running through doors, putting on the stuff. It's not even on. I think it's incredible."
2135,2020-04-05,"I'm telling you, the nearest thing I can think of is soldiers in battle and soldiers going right into battle, because that's what they're doing. It's really — in many ways, it's the same thing."
2136,2020-04-05,All right. How about one more?
2137,2020-04-05,Could be. I hope it's rescheduled. I hope — I hope football is able to start. I hope baseball can get to play a little bit. I hope basketball can maybe do their playoffs.
2138,2020-04-05,"I mean, hey, I have no — I have no interests or anything other than I want what's good for the country."
2139,2020-04-05,"Yeah, a lot of people are tired — yeah, a lot of people are tired of looking at games that are five years old. I looked the other day, I saw somebody, I said, “Wow, he looks great.” I forgot. I said, “Oh, that was nine years ago.” You know, I said, “He's really in great shape.” Well, not in a great shape now, but he was in great shape then. It was nine years ago."
2140,2020-04-05,"You know, you get tired of looking at 9-year-old baseball games and — and playoff games that took place 12 years ago. I don't have much time to do that, frankly, but that's what people are doing, and they want to see sports. Sports are a great thing for this country."
2141,2020-04-05,"And I hope football can start. And I told them, “I think you might be able to.” They may very well be able to. I hope they can start and I hope they can start with people in the stands. You know, we're not going to be separated. But you have seats. Those seats are meant for people to sit next to each other. And when this virus is gone, people are going to be sitting next to each other."
2142,2020-04-05,"And just for the restaurant industry, so they understand, when the virus is gone, people are going to be sitting next to each other. One man said, “I have a 200-seat restaurant. It's been great. But if I go by these rules, those 200 seats goes down to 60.” I said, “No, no. You have a 200-seat restaurant. That's what you have.” But we have to wait till the virus goes away. It wouldn't even do well at 60. Frankly, there's a warmth to it also. There's a warmth. But not when we have the virus in the air."
2143,2020-04-05,"Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. So I'm going to let our Vice President take over. He's got some really interesting numbers, statistics. And I want to thank the Admiral. I want to thank Tony and Deborah and everybody else. I want to thank everybody that's working. And I really do — I see a lot of tremendous things happening. And the therapeutics — the call I had today was one of the most exciting calls I've had in a long time."
2144,2020-04-05,"And again, I want to wish my best to the UK and the family of Boris Johnson. And we just hope he's going to be okay because he's — he's a fine guy."
2145,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you, Mike. Thanks."
2146,2020-04-05,"Beautiful day outside. And I think we have some great things to talk about. I'll start by discussing the Federal Reserve. As you know, it just happened minutes ago, but, to me, it makes me very happy. And I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve."
2147,2020-04-05,"For starters, they've lowered the Fed rate from what it was, which was 1 to 1.25. And it's been lowered down to zero, to 0.25 or .25. So it's 0 to .25. That's a big difference. It's quite a bit. It's about a point."
2148,2020-04-05,"And, in addition, very importantly, the Federal Reserve is the — going to be purchasing $500 billion of treasuries and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities. And that number can increase. But they're going to start with that, and that's really good news. It's really great for our country. It's something that we're very happy. I have to say this: I'm very happy. And they did it in one step; they didn't do it in four steps over a long period of time. They did it in one step."
2149,2020-04-05,"And I think that people in the market should be very thrilled. And that brings us — we're the strongest country in the world, by far, financially and every other way. And that brings us in line with what other countries are. They're actually — they actually have negative rates. But, look, we got it down to potentially zero. So that's a big step, and I'm very happy they did it."
2150,2020-04-05,"And you will not hear anything bad about me unless it's about a month or two from now. So I congratulate the Federal Reserve. I think it's terrific. It just came out, just as we spoke. I wasn't going to mention Federal Reserve or anything else, but this came out as we were walking up."
2151,2020-04-05,"I want to thank the people at Google and Google Communications because, as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who's a great gentleman, said — called us and he apologized. I don't know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace. But as you know — this is from Google — they put out a release. And you guys can figure it out yourselves. And how that got out — and I'm sure you'll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful."
2152,2020-04-05,"I just had a phone call with very impressive people — the biggest in the world, in the world of stores and groceries and all. And I'll give you the names:"
2153,2020-04-05,"Dave Clark, Whole Foods."
2154,2020-04-05,"Mark Clouse, CEO of Campbell Soup Company."
2155,2020-04-05,"Brian Cornell, CEO of Target."
2156,2020-04-05,"Randy Edeker, Chairman and CEO, President of Hy-Vee."
2157,2020-04-05,"Jeff Harmening, CEO of General Mills. A great company."
2158,2020-04-05,"Kevin Hourican, President and CEO of Sysco."
2159,2020-04-05,"Craig Jelinek, CEO of Costco."
2160,2020-04-05,"Todd Jones, CEO of Publix Super Markets."
2161,2020-04-05,"Donnie King, Tyson Foods."
2162,2020-04-05,"David MacLennan, Chairman and CEO of Cargill."
2163,2020-04-05,"Rodney McMullan, CEO, Chairman of Kroger — a big company."
2164,2020-04-05,"Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart. He's been fantastic. Doug was here, as you know, on Friday. And he watched the market go up 2,000 points. On Friday, it went up 2,000 — almost 2,000 points."
2165,2020-04-05,"Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General Corporation."
2166,2020-04-05,"And Vivek Sankaran, President and CEO of Albertsons."
2167,2020-04-05,So these are all phenomenal companies. These are great companies. We had a long conversation with them. And they've — they're going to work 24 hours around the clock keeping their store stocked.
2168,2020-04-05,I would like to say that people shouldn't go out and buy. We're going to all be great. We're going to be so good. We're going to do — what's happened with the Fed is phenomenal news. What's happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news.
2169,2020-04-05,"But you don't have to buy so much. Take it easy. Just relax. People are going in and they're buying more. I remember — I guess, during the conversation, Doug of Walmart said that they're buying more than they buy at Christmas. Relax. We're doing great. It all will pass."
2170,2020-04-05,"The folks that we spoke to, they've done a fantastic job. They're going to meet the needs of the public. They're going around the clock, if they have to. And they're committed to the communities where they're serving and which they serve so beautifully and have for a long time. And they're buying a lot of additional things to sell."
2171,2020-04-05,"But again, they — they actually have asked me to say, “Could you buy a little bit less, please?” I think — I thought I'd never hear that from a retailer."
2172,2020-04-05,"All of them are working hand-in-hand with the federal government, as well as the state and local leaders, to ensure food and essentials are constantly available. And they'll do it. There's no shortages. We have no shortages — other than people are buying anywhere from three to five times what they would normally buy. It's going to be there for a long time."
2173,2020-04-05,"We're doing numbers, and there's a pent-up demand that's incredible. When this passes, when this goes through, you're going to see numbers — I think, I predict; I guess I'm allowed to predict just like Wall Street people are allowed to predict, and they're pretty much in agreement — you're going to see there's a pent-up demand like — like a lot of people, including me, haven't seen before. But this has to get through."
2174,2020-04-05,"They know they're getting through the crisis and will require an all-of-America approach, and that's very important. They're committed to remaining open during this crisis. Totally open. They have to stay open. Those stores have to stay open. They supply our country."
2175,2020-04-05,"Our supply chains in America are the most powerful in the world, and they're all working very hard. They're working around the clock. And the stores are stocking up at a level that's beyond Christmastime. And it's — it's great. It was very reassuring speaking to these people. They have it totally in hand."
2176,2020-04-05,"There's no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies. They said to me, “Could you please tell them just go and buy, enjoy it.” Have a nice dinner. Relax. Because there's plenty. But you don't have to the quantities because it's hard to refill the stores on a basis as rapid as they're refilling them."
2177,2020-04-05,"And we're using the full power of the federal government to defeat the coronavirus, and we will do whatever it takes. And we're doing, I think, really, really well. A lot of good things are going to happen."
2178,2020-04-05,"I want to thank all of the people standing behind me. You know, these are phenomenal people, and we have some of them right over here. But the people behind me have been working around the clock, and they're doing an incredible job."
2179,2020-04-05,"We see what's happening. We see what's going on in other countries. We're looking at — we're learning from watching other countries, frankly. This is a very contagious — this is a very contagious virus. It's incredible. But it's something that we have tremendous control over."
2180,2020-04-05,"I think, very important, the young people and people of good health, and groups of people, just are not strongly affected. Elderly people that are not well, or not well in certain respects, are, really, a very dangerous group. We have to watch them. We have to protect them very much. We have to really watch over them and protect them because they are very vulnerable."
2181,2020-04-05,"And with that, if it's okay, I'm just going to go and make some calls. I'm talking about Federal Reserve. I think it's a tremendous thing that took place just now. I didn't know I'd be surprised on a Sunday. I don't know if that's ever happened on a Sunday before. But I would think there are a lot of people on Wall Street that are very happy. And I can tell you that I'm very happy. I didn't expect this, and I like being surprised."
2182,2020-04-05,"So our Vice President, who's doing an incredible job, is going to take over. And I will see you probably tomorrow. Thank you very much."
2183,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. We just completed a very good meeting of the Coronavirus Task Force. And we — we're really — they're really doing a great job, our professionals. The results are very — very, very good. And when you compare this to what's happening around the world, we're very proud of our people."
2184,2020-04-05,"And there's been a tremendous amount of coordination with states, with cities, and they're a little smaller form of government, and they have things going well. They're coordinating with us. And certain, in particular, I think California has been terrific — the relationship. New York has been really good. We've had some really good relationships in terms of — especially the hotspots. And we're focused on those hotspots. In some areas, we don't have no problem whatsoever, and we hope to keep it that way."
2185,2020-04-05,"Before I turn this over to our great Vice President to provide an update, I just want to express my appreciation for the hard work done by the people behind me and the people back in the various offices, including the fact that I just left the Oval Office. So we have some people there that are probably watching this or they're just working. We're using the full power of the federal government to defeat the virus, and that's what we've been doing."
2186,2020-04-05,"Last week, we secured an initial $8.3 billion from Congress for the coronavirus, and that was quickly done and very efficiently done. And I want to thank all members of Congress."
2187,2020-04-05,"Yesterday, I declared a national emergency, which was a very big deal because it opened up avenues that we would never be able to open up without it. And it will make it more than — it will make more than $50 billion available to us immediately in disaster relief funds. And that's available for states, territories, and local governments. So that was really, really good."
2188,2020-04-05,"We also reached an agreement yesterday on a new legislative package that will provide strong support for American families and communities in dealing with the coronavirus. So it was done very, very bipartisan. It was — it was very nice to see it. Probably the cooperation — I want to thank Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, who did a fantastic job and worked with Nancy Pelosi and their representatives. And it was really great. It worked out very well."
2189,2020-04-05,"And a lot of people are benefitting by a lot of — a lot of provisions in the bill, which they're going to be discussing with you today. And the tremendous provision. So that's something that we should talk about."
2190,2020-04-05,"I was honored to see that the stock market — you were mostly there with us — set a record in a short period of time — over a 45-minute period that we had the press conference yesterday in the Rose Garden. That was a record. All-time record. I think we should do one of them every day, perhaps. How about every — how about five times a day? We'll do one five times a day. But that was something to watch. And I had no idea. We walked back, I said, “So how did that work out?” They said, “Sir, you just set a new record in the history of the stock market.” So that was pretty good."
2191,2020-04-05,"And those great companies that were there, they couldn't have been too unhappy either, when you think about it, because they're all very big, publicly listed companies. So they did a good job. And more importantly, they're going to do a good job. When you look at CVS and Walmart, and all of the tremendous people that were there yesterday, these are the biggest and the best. And they're opening up their facilities. They're opening up — they're, right now, literally, working right now on opening — doing something that's never been done before, to the extent that we're doing it. And so we're very proud of them also."
2192,2020-04-05,"The bill provides for free coronavirus testing for all Americans who should be tested. So people that are getting tested are getting this free. They don't have to pay — because a lot of people said, “Gee, it's a lot of money.” And it is. It's a — you know, it's a pretty complex test actually, and it costs money. And it's being provided free, so people don't have to worry about that."
2193,2020-04-05,"It also provides paid sick and family medical leave for those who need it, including for those who have the virus, for caregivers, and those looking after children affected by school closures. So that's all taken care of also. And we'll continue all of these different actions. We have other things planned."
2194,2020-04-05,"We're going to also be working with companies that are affected financially. Our country is in the best financial shape. We've — it's so different than in the past, over the years. If you look at some of the real big crises we had, it was financial problems and different things. We now are in very, very strong financial shape with all of the trade and all of the other things that we've been doing. It's been pretty amazing."
2195,2020-04-05,"We hope the Federal Reserve will finally get on board and do what they should do, because we're doing things that they should be doing, frankly. And we can all do them together, but they should be much more proactive. Other boards and other countries and people representing those countries are taking a much more aggressive action than our Fed, for the most part."
2196,2020-04-05,"So we'd like to see the — you know, if you look at central banks — yesterday, what they did — we want to see our Federal Reserve be much more proactive. It's important. But in the meantime, we're doing things that — that are — that have been really well received. Now, I guess you saw that yesterday at the end of the day with what we've done."
2197,2020-04-05,"We have a lot of things to tell you, in terms of respirators, in terms of all of the different things. The masks are being made by the millions. Millions and millions. We have plenty now, but we're ordering for the millions. We're ordering worst-case scenario. Always — we always say “worst-case scenario.” And that's where we're going. So I just want to thank everybody."
2198,2020-04-05,"I think the press has been really — over the last 24 hours, I think the representation has really been very fair. For the most part, been very fair."
2199,2020-04-05,"We're all in this together. It's something that nobody expected. It came out of China, and it's one of those things that happened. It's nobody's fault. We all — we all will solve this problem; we'll solve it well."
2200,2020-04-05,"I think the American people have been incredible in the way they've acted. There's been — and if you look at companies and sports leagues and all of the things, what they've done is — is just something very special, without being told, necessarily. In some cases, perhaps they were told, actually. But for the most part, they want to get it over with. They want to get it over with quickly and with very little death."
2201,2020-04-05,"As of this moment we have 50 deaths, which is — a lot of good decisions were made, or that number could be many times that. But that's based on a lot of good decisions, one or two in particular. You know that Europe was declared the hotspot yesterday, a big hotspot and number one. And we — we made a decision quite a bit prior to that, but we saw what was happening."
2202,2020-04-05,"But if you have any questions, this group will be very happy to do it. But I just want to say they have been — led by Mike Pence — they have been incredible, the job they're doing. They're working 20 hours a day. This man is working 20 hours a day or maybe more. Is it more? I think it's more. Tony has been working — I'm just looking at this whole group. And we've created a number of new stars, including the gentleman right behind me. I watched him the other day. It was such a fantastic job you did, and I really appreciate it."
2203,2020-04-05,"But they're going to be answering questions. And we have a lot of new information, so I think you'll find it very interesting. And I'll be going back to the Oval Office."
2204,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
2205,2020-04-05,"I think it's fine if they do it. I think it's — frankly, it's good if they do it. I think what Apple did is fine. And — want to keep people away for a little while. Just keep them away."
2206,2020-04-05,"And, you know, when it gets better — well, people are going and buying things, and I understand that."
2207,2020-04-05,"By the way, I had my temperature taken coming into the room."
2208,2020-04-05,You did? Good.
2209,2020-04-05,Let's compare. Do you want to compare?
2210,2020-04-05,Good. We'll we're — that means we're all looking good. You also took — I also took the test last night.
2211,2020-04-05,"Yeah. And I decided I should, based on the press conference yesterday. People were asking that I take the test."
2212,2020-04-05,I don't know. Whatever it takes. A day or two days. Whatever — whatever it is. They send it to a lab. But I've been —
2213,2020-04-05,Only because the press is going crazy.
2214,2020-04-05,"No, I've been urgent. This is urgent for me, right from the beginning. You know that because I closed up our country to China."
2215,2020-04-05,"Because it almost becomes a habit, and you get out of that habit. And, frankly, I was a non-hand-shaker, for the most part. I've never believed that shaking hands — once you become a politician. And I notice it too: Political people walk up to me, they want to shake my hand. I said, “Well, you know” —"
2216,2020-04-05,"Just wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just take it nice and easy, okay? Just relax."
2217,2020-04-05,"People come up to me, they shake hands, they put their hand out. It's sort of a natural reflex, and we're all getting out of it. All of us have that problem. Somebody comes up to you, they put their hand out — you probably tend to just shake it. And we're all getting out of that. Shaking hands is not a great thing to be doing right now, I agree. But people put their hand out. Sometimes I'll put the hand out. You don't think about it. People are thinking about it more and more. We have to think about it; it's important."
2218,2020-04-05,"Somebody said yesterday I touched the microphone. I was touching it because we have different height people and I'm trying to make it easy for them because they're going to have to touch, because they wouldn't be able to reach the mic; they wouldn't be able to speak in the mic. So I'll move the mic down. And they said, “Oh, he touched the microphone.” Well, if I don't touch it, they're going to have to touch it. Somebody is going to have to, so I might as well be the one to do it."
2219,2020-04-05,"But, no, we all have to get away from — I mean, getting away from shaking hands is a good thing, and possibly that's something that comes out of this. Maybe people shouldn't be shaking hands for the long term because it does transmit flu and other things. You know, we have flu in our country that kills, on average, 36,000 people a year — 36,000 people. And, you know, that's something that we're not talking about. But as of this moment, we've lost 50 — possibly a little bit less than 50 — but probably 50 people. And we're going to try and keep that number as low as possible."
2220,2020-04-05,"Well, if you don't have to travel, I wouldn't do it. If you don't have to travel — we want this thing to end. We don't want a lot of people getting infected. We want it to end, and end as quickly as possible. So far, I think we've done a fantastic job. I really think that the people behind me have not been given the credit that they deserve, because they have done a fantastic job."
2221,2020-04-05,"When you see all these school closures, when you see — the school closures are very important but it causes a lot of problems. The bill that we signed yesterday takes care of a lot of those problems with children staying at home and the parents are working. Now we take care of that issue with what we passed last night. Now, it has to go through the Senate. I have to sign it. But that will happen."
2222,2020-04-05,But I'm now going back to the White House. You have great professionals. And if there's anything that comes up — if there's anything —
2223,2020-04-05,Yes.
2224,2020-04-05,Yes.
2225,2020-04-05,"Specifically from certain areas. Yes, we are. And we're working with the states, and we are considering other restrictions, yes."
2226,2020-04-05,"We're looking at it very seriously, yeah — because they've had a little bit of activity, unfortunately, so we're going to be looking at that. We are — actually already have looked at it, and that is going to be announced."
2227,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2228,2020-04-05,"No, I think I have the right to do that or the right to remove him as chairman. He's — he has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion. We had this great — and we will soon have again, because I think you're going to have a tremendous bounce when this is over. I think there's a pent-up bounce that's going to be tremendous. I think you saw that yesterday with the stock market."
2229,2020-04-05,"No, I'm not happy with the Fed because I think that they are following, not leading. We should be leading. I'm not happy because, if you look at the central banks of other — you know, other central banks — largely, they're lower than us, their rate. And their equivalent of the Fed rate is lower, in some cases by two points. In some cases — that's a lot. In some cases, very substantially."
2230,2020-04-05,"And I thought that the Fed would be and should be much more proactive as opposed to following. Our Fed is following. We have the number one currency in the world by a factor of many times, as you know. We have the currency; we have the power. We have, by far, the strong currency. Also, you look at the dollar — the strength of the dollar. Our Fed is not doing what they should be doing."
2231,2020-04-05,"We shouldn't have a Fed rate that's higher than our competitor nations. If you look at Germany, they're essentially under zero; they're negative. There are many countries negative. Japan is negative. Germany is negative. Others are negative. And we're paying higher interest rates."
2232,2020-04-05,"And what I'd like to do is, frankly, refinance our debt. We could refinance our debt very easily at a much lower rate. We have a — we have some tremendous opportunities right now, but Jerome Powell is not making it easy."
2233,2020-04-05,"No, I have the right to remove. I'm not doing that."
2234,2020-04-05,"No, I'm not doing that. I have the right to also take him and put him in a regular position and put somebody else in charge. And I haven't made any decisions on that."
2235,2020-04-05,Thank you.
2236,2020-04-05,Totally normal. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
2237,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much everybody, and good afternoon. Today is Good Friday. And this Sunday, millions of Christians celebrate Easter and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. At this holy time, we pray that God will heal the sick and comfort the heartbroken and bless our heroes. As American families look forward to Easter, we're reminded that our story ends not in despair, but in triumph and renewal. Very appropriate, isn't it?"
2238,2020-04-05,"I'd like to provide Americans an update on our ongoing efforts in the war against the invisible enemy. Before I do that, I'll have a couple of notes. The United States, in discussions last night with Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and –dealing with OPEC nations — we are trying to get Mexico, as the expression goes, “over the barrel.” And Mexico is committing to do 100,000 fewer barrels."
2239,2020-04-05,"The President and I spoke last night. We have a great relationship, great friendship. They're helping us very much at the border. They have 27,000 soldiers — Mexican soldiers — on our border right now, stopping people from coming into our country as our wall goes up. We're up to about 168 miles of wall."
2240,2020-04-05,"And in speaking with the President, they have a limit. The OPEC nations have agreed to a different limit: a reduction of about 23 percent. So what I thought I would do — and I don't know that it's going to be accepted; we'll find out — the United States will help Mexico along and they'll reimburse us sometime at a later date when they're prepared to do so."
2241,2020-04-05,"And we had a great conversation, but we'll find out how that all works out. As you know, they're trying to get rid of the glut of oil. There's a tremendous glut of oil. And we don't want anything to hurt our incredible industry. We're actually the largest producer in the world now, so we don't want anything to hurt those jobs — those great jobs in Texas and North Dakota, in Oklahoma, and everywhere. We have a tremendous energy — New Mexico — tremendous energy business. And we want to keep those jobs."
2242,2020-04-05,"So we're — we're working on it. I think, eventually, it's going to work out. It may work out quicker than what most people thought possible. And maybe it won't, but it'll work out eventually."
2243,2020-04-05,"Our experts are monitoring the data from every part of our country having to do with the topic that we're here to discuss. In the midst of grief and pain, we're seeing clear signs that our aggressive strategy is saving countless lives. Tremendous progress is being made. Although when you look at some of the numbers — I just spoke with Governor Cuomo; we had a good talk. When you look at those numbers — the numbers of death, people that have died — it's so horrible."
2244,2020-04-05,"Now, on the other side, you have the numbers of beds being used, we were just saying, are substantially reduced. That's usually the sign that it's heading in the downward curve. So, New York, we know where that is. But in the midst of all this grief and this pain, we're seeing these signs and we're seeing them very strongly. And a lot of that has to do with the aggressive strategy in saving so many lives. We're saving so many lives compared to what it could have been."
2245,2020-04-05,"So, nobody knows what the number is, but we had a number of 100,000 lives. As many as that is, it's impossible to even think of it. And that was the low end with a tremendous amount of work and a tremendous amount of — you can call it many different things. Our people had to be extremely strong and brave to be able to put up with what they've put up with. But the minimum, if you did this social distancing at every other aspect — and I think I can say 90 percent, maybe even more than that, were able to do it — the minimum number was 100,000 lives, and I think we'll be substantially under that number."
2246,2020-04-05,"Hard to believe that if you had 60,000 — you could never be happy, but that's a lot fewer than we were originally told and thinking. So they said between 100- and 220,000 lives on the minimum side, and then up to 2.2 million lives if we didn't do anything. But it showed a just tremendous resolve by the people of this country."
2247,2020-04-05,"So we'll see what it ends up being, but it looks like we're headed to a number substantially below the 100,000. That would be the low mark. And I hope that bears out."
2248,2020-04-05,"The situation in Detroit and New Orleans appears to be stabilizing. Detroit has really started to go up, and now it is stabilizing. And New Orleans is a great place; I have so many friends there. They can't believe what's happening, but it's really stabilized. I spoke with the governor of Louisiana. And, as you know, we're building them additional beds right now — the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA — and that is going to be done. And I hope they're not going to be very well used because I think they've really — I don't think they're going to need them or certainly not very many of them. We built them a big hospital of 1,000 beds and now we're — we're in the midst of doing another 1,000. I don't think they're going to be using very many of them, and that's a good thing."
2249,2020-04-05,"There was a time, two weeks ago, where we said, “That's not going to be nearly enough. We're going to have to build more.” But we wanted to wait to see and I'm glad we waited. It just looks like they're doing really well. Louisiana and the state of Michigan is doing, really, much better than we thought."
2250,2020-04-05,"In Washington State, we've made enough progress that the governor is now able to return an Army field hospital, so we're going to take that hospital. We don't think we need any more hospitals. We built thousands of beds all over the country, and we think we're probably not going to need that hospital anyway. And if we do, we're ready to move it to a different location."
2251,2020-04-05,"In New York, we're seeing hospital admissions declining very substantially, as I said. And nationwide, the number of new cases per day is flattening substantially, suggesting that we are near the peak and our comprehensive strategy is working."
2252,2020-04-05,"Over time, our guidelines to slow the spread are decreasing the rate of new cases very substantially and will result in fewer hospital admissions. And we're seeing that; it's incredible. I think, with no exceptions, it's looking like it's lower. And again, that's because of the people doing what they had to do. Great people. And working with elected representatives and — and the doctors, the nurses, and everybody — I mean, just everybody. Everybody is so, so — has been so amazing."
2253,2020-04-05,"I was told this morning again, “Please mention all of those people working in the grocery stores.” And it's true. The checkouts and the clerks and the people that are really — and a number of those people have become infected. So we want to thank them and a shout-out to them."
2254,2020-04-05,"With the tireless devotion of American doctors and nurses and all of the medical people, we've kept our fatality rate very, very low compared to other countries. My administration is closely monitoring the data on the virus's impact on our cherished African American communities because they've been hit hard. And the Surgeon General will be sharing more of that information right after we're finished here. He'll be coming up and saying exactly what's happening because it's really — it's very troublesome, I will tell you that."
2255,2020-04-05,"I'd also like to provide clarity on the important point for many Americans on elective surgeries. While we've asked hospitals to cancel surgeries and procedures that do not take place at this time, just not to do them now — the choice to delay any treatment still remains between the patient and their doctor. We're not advising Americans to postpone medical treatment that the doctor believes should occur now. So it's different kinds of surgery, obviously, but we're really getting to the point where you can start to think about doing that surgery, if necessary, pretty soon, I think. Pretty soon."
2256,2020-04-05,"Yesterday, I directed Secretary of Agriculture Sonny to — Sonny Perdue to expedite aid to American farmers. And Secretary Perdue will be using all of the tools at his disposal to develop a program — and very quickly — of at least $16 billion to provide relief for farmers, ranchers, and producers impacted by the coronavirus."
2257,2020-04-05,"In this time of crisis, we must keep our supply chains moving from the beginning — right from beginning to end. And we're committed to supporting the amazing men and women who produce supply. I did, last night, a statement on social media, and I said I have directed Secretary Sonny Perdue to expedite help to our farmers, especially to the smaller farmers who are very, very badly hurting right now. I expect Secretary Perdue to use all of the funds and authorities at his disposal to make sure that our food supply is stable and safe, and our great farmers are prosperous and continue to be prosperous."
2258,2020-04-05,"We're working very hard to make sure our food supply chain is sound and plentiful, but we all know that that begins with our farmers, cattlemen, ranchers, and producers. So we're going to be working with the small farmers, the big farmers, the cattlemen, the ranchers — all of the producers. We're going to take care of them. We're working with them right now. We have a lot of money that was put there through our use of tariffs and other means, and we're going to help out our farmers."
2259,2020-04-05,"And I don't think — I tell you, I've been helping our farmers for a couple of years because they were targeted, as you know, by China and others. And I think they're very grateful to what — for what we've done."
2260,2020-04-05,"On the medical front, the FDA — FDA has issued 47 emergency use authorizations for advancements and testing new ventilator designs, innovations, and personal protective equipment, and experimental medicines. And Dr. Hahn is going to be talking about that. We've cut through the red tape to give doctors and patients unprecedented freedom to make their own healthcare decisions, granting access to potential therapies and drugs."
2261,2020-04-05,"Since Monday, we've deployed two major shipments of hydroxychloroquine from our National Stockpile. And it's going to various cities."
2262,2020-04-05,"And we are also disposing and getting, as quickly as we can, portions of it to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense. And speaking of the Department of Defense, they're going to be sending us 10 million N95 masks that they had. And we're in great shape in every way. We're in great shape with ventilators. We're in great shape with protective clothing. We have additional planeloads coming in."
2263,2020-04-05,"But we're not getting any calls from governors at this moment. I can speak, I think for — Vice President Pence will be talking in a little while. We're getting — we're getting very few calls from governors or anybody else needing anything. They're in great shape for this surge that's coming in certain areas in particular, and that's a good job. You've done a great job on that, Mike. Really, a great job. I appreciate it. The whole country appreciates it."
2264,2020-04-05,"More than 2 million coronavirus tests have now been completed, and we're conducting approximately 100,000 more every day. We're also working to bring blood-based serology tests to the market as quickly as possible so that Americans can determine whether or not they have already had the virus and potentially have immunity."
2265,2020-04-05,"They have immunity if they've had the virus. A lot of them don't even know if they've had it. Sometimes it's brutal. You see the Prime Minister seems to be doing well now, I hope. He had a rough go of it, and still is, but he's doing better. And then some people don't even know they had it. It could be sniffles. It could be they don't feel perfect, but they've had it. And they're the lucky ones."
2266,2020-04-05,"The NIH, CDC, and FDA are currently validating these antibody tests to ensure that they are accurate, and they're doing that at breakneck speed. I think we can say that, Doctor. And we're going to get them approved very quickly — Dr. Hahn."
2267,2020-04-05,"When validated, we're confident that the production will scale up to tens of millions of tests very quickly. We're leading the world now in testing, by far, and we're going to keep it that way. Other countries are coming to us, and they're wanting to know about our tests and can they buy the tests, and can they do whatever they have to do to get the tests. And we're going to make that — very soon, we'll be in a position to make that possible because it's important for them to have it."
2268,2020-04-05,"And we're going to have an announcement on the World Health Organization sometime next week. As you know, we give them approximately $500 million a year, and we're going to be talking about that subject next week. We'll have a lot to say about it. We'll hold it."
2269,2020-04-05,"Every American should be proud of what our country has achieved in just a short period of time. The U.S. military has deployed thousands of personnel to build 23 temporary hospitals with more than 16,000 beds. And we have the potential to build many more if we needed them, but we're all ready to go. But I don't think we're going to need them, which is great — great news."
2270,2020-04-05,"And we built those hospitals in 12 states and the District of Columbia using the Defense Production Act. And we used it like a hammer. A lot of the media said: Oh, we weren't using it. We used it like a hammer to a point where all we had to do was say the words and everybody gave us max. And they've done a good job. They really have done a good job, with few exceptions."
2271,2020-04-05,"And we've harnessed the full power of American industry to produce ventilators and other essential supplies. Right now, we're making thousands of ventilators, many of which we won't need, but we'll use them in our stockpile. And we'll build that up. We'll also help build up the stockpiles, which they should have had in the states. And so we're working with governors on that, and we'll also help other countries or countries that are calling us for help, if they need ventilators and they're in no no position to build ventilators. We are. We have Ford and General Motors, and many, many companies are building ventilators."
2272,2020-04-05,"So we're going to be helping — at a not-too-distant point, we're going to be helping quite a few of the countries."
2273,2020-04-05,"Now, we've launched Project Airbridge to deliver nearly 300 million pieces of personal protective equipment from and around the globe. We're also shipping out 60 sterilization systems to 10 different cities that can each sterilize up to 80,000 masks each day, and I'm even hearing it can go up to 120,000 masks a day — certain equipment with certain additions. It's a company in Ohio that makes it. It's a great company. Great — I hear it's a great product. It works very well."
2274,2020-04-05,"I asked that question; I said, “How come we have to buy so many masks? Why can't we sterilize the masks that are being used?” And the answer was, “You can.” In this case, they say, up to 20 times. So we can take a mask — certain types of masks — the N95s in particular — and we can sterilize them, make them very clean, up to 20 times. That's a great thing."
2275,2020-04-05,"In addition, we passed the largest emergency economic relief package in American history to save the U.S. economy and protect the American worker. As you know, this past week, which was four active days on the stock market — Good Friday today is not — is not included; the markets are closed. In four days, we had the biggest market increase — stock market increase that we've had in 50 years. That tells you that there's a pent-up demand. That tells you they want to get back. There's something good going to happen. I really believe that. There's something very good going to happen. We have to get back."
2276,2020-04-05,"So think of it: In this horrible period, this horrible, dark period where this — this monster came and worked its horrible, horrible spell over the world — 184 countries as of this morning. A hundred and eighty-four countries."
2277,2020-04-05,"We've done well, and I guess the market thinks we've done well, because we hit the biggest stock market increase without one day — we're talking four days instead of five — that we've had in 50 years. Fifty years. Think of that. More than 50 years, actually."
2278,2020-04-05,"In short, the American people have launched the greatest mobilization of our society since World War Two, deploying every scientific, governmental, medical, and military resource to defeat the virus."
2279,2020-04-05,"So I want to just start then with — we're going to answer questions later. We'll have time. I think we have a lot of time today. A lot of people are off, as they should be. Good Friday."
2280,2020-04-05,"But — so I'll stick around, and we'll answer questions later. I want to start with Deborah Birx, please. Dr. Birx. And you can go over some of the numbers we just looked at, and that'd be great."
2281,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, Deborah."
2282,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, Deborah."
2283,2020-04-05,"Doctor, please."
2284,2020-04-05,"Please, Doctor."
2285,2020-04-05,Thank you.
2286,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Please.
2287,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you.
2288,2020-04-05,"Mike, please."
2289,2020-04-05,Thank you. Great job. Thank you.
2290,2020-04-05,"Okay, it's Good Friday. Let's be nice. Okay? Let's be real nice. Yeah, please. Go ahead."
2291,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2292,2020-04-05,"So all of the OPEC nations met, and others, and they're all agreeing to cut back because there's a tremendous glut. We don't even — we're filling up our strategic reserves. We don't even have room to store it. In fact, they're using ships to store oil. There's never been anything like this."
2293,2020-04-05,"It was being overproduced to start off with, and then you had the virus and that took off 40 percent right there. So we have — there's a glut of oil like nobody has ever seen before. It's good in many ways and, depending on where you are, who you are, it's bad. We have a tremendous energy business with hundreds of thousands of jobs. We're doing great. Number one in the world."
2294,2020-04-05,"So, they all got together and they said, “We're going to cut it, because we have to get rid of this tremendous supply.”"
2295,2020-04-05,"Now, the good news is, gasoline prices — I'm seeing 90 cents, 85 cents, in different parts of the country, a gallon. Nobody has ever seen that. I guess you have to go back to the 1950s where they had the big large dollar bills, remember? You don't remember; you're too young. But the fact that you have to go back a long ways to see it."
2296,2020-04-05,"So there's some good. The airlines are trying to come back, having low fuel costs is good for them — and other reasons. Steel manufacturing — but a lot of the steel goes to building what we do for the oil and engineering firms. So, you know, that's a — that's a double-edged sword."
2297,2020-04-05,"But it's — it's — we want to keep our energy. We want to remain independent. We will remain independent, I think, regardless. But we want to get rid of this tremendous overflow. There's no place to even store it."
2298,2020-04-05,"So the OPEC nations met. They've been meeting. And, you know, I've hated OPEC over the years, absolutely hated them. But obviously it broke down and we potentially have years' worth of supply. A long time before it ever can catch up, even if they do reduce it."
2299,2020-04-05,"And they agreed, but Mexico didn't agree. It was one of the few countries that didn't agree. This is OPEC-Plus. These are OPEC-Plus countries outside — you understand? And Mexico didn't agree. And I understand the President very well. He has a level when he came in, and he wanted to keep it at that level. Oil is important for Mexico. The problem is — and I explained it very strongly — you know, you're going to be selling it for $5 or $10 a barrel. So, in the end, it's bad."
2300,2020-04-05,"But he did have some political difficulty with it, frankly, and I understand that too. And it's a small amount for us. It's a large amount for Mexico, but it's a very small amount for the United States, being the biggest producer. So I agreed to pick up some of the slack. So he was going to reduce it by 100,000 barrels — reduce his output by 100,000 barrels. And I was going to pick up the slack and they would make it up to us at a later date. They would make up what we're doing at a later date. It could be in a different form."
2301,2020-04-05,"And I don't know whether or not that's going to be — for Mexico, it was acceptable. I don't know whether or not that's going to be acceptable to the other oil-producing nations. We'll find out. But it's something that would certainly be acceptable to me to get it over the back. So Mexico is going to reduce by 100,000 barrels, and that would mean that they're 250 to 300 barrels short. We'd make up the difference. They would reimburse us at a later date. Okay?"
2302,2020-04-05,"By cutting some U.S. production. Now, the U.S, production has already been cut, because we're a market-driven economy and — and oil is very market driven. They've been cutting oil all over the place. We're cutting it back."
2303,2020-04-05,"And what does it mean really? It means we have it in the ground. We can use it. Now we have a lot of — we have a lot of ground with a lot of oil in it. I think we're number one in that too. We're probably number one, especially with ANWR. As you know, I got ANWR approved in Alaska. That's one of the biggest finds anywhere in the world."
2304,2020-04-05,"So when you add it all up, I think we're probably number one, even in what we have under- — we're very lucky. We were — we grew up in a land that was rich in a lot of ways, but it's also rich because it has a lot of oil underneath — oil and gas."
2305,2020-04-05,"And as, you know, natural gas — LNG — is all over the country now at a very low price. And our carbon, our atmosphere, our — the level of environmental cleanliness is at its all-time best right now. All-time best. Because we are using a lot of natural gas."
2306,2020-04-05,"But we have many forms of energy, including some of the newer forms that people want to see us go to. We have a lot of different forms of energy. We're number one in the world. We want to keep it that way."
2307,2020-04-05,"So we're helping Mexico out. We will be reimbursed, in a form, sometime in the future."
2308,2020-04-05,Please.
2309,2020-04-05,"Well, I think we're going to have it in retreat. Will it be today? No. Tomorrow? No. But it will be — at a certain point in the not-too-distant future, it will be gone."
2310,2020-04-05,"Well, we'll know. We'll know because people aren't going to go to the hospital, people aren't going to get sick. You're going to know that without — but we're going to do very substantial testing. We're doing more testing right now than any other country in the world by far."
2311,2020-04-05,"And if you'd like to have that question answered, I'll have the professional answer it. Deborah, perhaps you could come up. We are doing tremendous testing, but you'll know. You're going to know before anybody, because you're going to see nobody's getting sick anymore. It will be gone, and it won't be that much longer."
2312,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
2313,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
2314,2020-04-05,Let you ask who?
2315,2020-04-05,I have not. When did they say this would take place? When?
2316,2020-04-05,"Oh, well, we'll talk about that. Doctor, would you like to talk about that?"
2317,2020-04-05,"I haven't — they haven't seen it. I guess, you're seeing — I guess they leaked it to NBC."
2318,2020-04-05,"Nobody has it. And they're the ones that do it, so."
2319,2020-04-05,We'll find out about it. They don't know about it.
2320,2020-04-05,"Do you want to say something, Tony? Go ahead."
2321,2020-04-05,"Look, I think we're going to do both. We're going to go back to work and we're going to stay healthy. And staying healthy is also a proportion. If you look at what we're doing, we're looking at a date — we hope we're going to be able to fulfill a certain date — but we're not doing anything until we know that this country is going to be healthy. We don't want to go back and start doing it over again, even though it would be in a smaller scale."
2322,2020-04-05,"Yeah, Jeff. Go ahead."
2323,2020-04-05,"Yes, we would — which we've already done, by the way. But we would agree to a reduction cut; they would agree to do something to compensate us in the future. Okay?"
2324,2020-04-05,"We didn't discuss that with Saudi Arabia. We just discussed the numbers and we discussed who is opposed and who is not. And pretty much everybody is in favor of it, because they're getting clobbered. They're all getting clobbered. All of those countries are having problems."
2325,2020-04-05,"If you look at Saudi Arabia, that's their source of income — primary source of income, by far. So they want to do it. Russia wants to do it. The OPEC nations want to do it. They all want to do it. So we'll see what happens. There's a difference between wanting to do it and doing it."
2326,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead. OAN, in the back."
2327,2020-04-05,Venezuela. Go ahead.
2328,2020-04-05,"Yeah. We will not be happy if that takes place. I have not spoken to President Xi of China about Venezuela — about that aspect of Venezuela. But if that took place, we will not be happy. Okay? I will not be happy."
2329,2020-04-05,I'm concerned about everything. I'm concerned about everything. That's why I don't sleep a lot. I get myself concerned about everything. But I would not be happy about that. Go ahead.
2330,2020-04-05,"I listen to them about everything. I think they're actually surprised. I have great respect for these people. All of them. You, look —"
2331,2020-04-05,"And others that are working with us. I have great respect for this group. In fact, I told Tony Fauci — I said, “Why don't you move to New York, run against AOC? You will win easily.” But he decided that he's not going to do that, okay? I kid. By the way —"
2332,2020-04-05,— you know that —
2333,2020-04-05,"I can only say this: I have tremendous respect for these people and we've done very well. And when you look at us compared to others — we're a big nation. When you look at us compared to others, when you see how we've taken testing from a broken system that I inherited to having the best tests that anyone has made anywhere in the world — and other countries are calling us, wanting to use our technology. I have great respect for these people."
2334,2020-04-05,I'm never saying bad about these people.
2335,2020-04-05,I will certainly listen. I will certainly listen.
2336,2020-04-05,"There are two sides. Remember, there is — I know — I understand the other side of the argument very well because I look at both sides of an argument. I will listen to them very carefully though."
2337,2020-04-05,Please. Go ahead.
2338,2020-04-05,"I think my economic advisors are interested in the third quarter and really the fourth quarter. And I think we have a chance to do record fourth quarter numbers, because there's a tremendous pent-up demand. And you see it this week — I mean, what reason would there be, other than faith in us and in this country? Faith in this group — and me, and our Vice President, and everybody. Governors, perhaps. You can add them into it also. What reason would that be for — in a shortened week, four days instead of five — to have the biggest stock market gain in over 50 years? So, I think that — you know, to me, there's a sign."
2339,2020-04-05,"Hey, look, with all we've been down — I mean, we've — we've never been hit — I don't know, has this country ever been hit like this? Probably not. 1917, but that was different, and it was a different time, and, frankly, Europe took the brunt of it. We didn't, but it was a terrible time also. But, probably, never been hit like this, right?"
2340,2020-04-05,"Somebody was saying — in fact, I was speaking with Governor Cuomo about it. Because we were in New York City — a place we love, New York State — with the World Trade Center. And that was approximately 3,000 people. Well, we've doubled that. In this same area, we've doubled that — more than doubled it, substantially more. And it's obviously going. You know, we had our highest number yesterday and the day before."
2341,2020-04-05,"Okay. With all of this news, what would lead you to believe that we're going to have the best stock market week — shortened week — in 50 years? Almost broke the all-time record. You know what that is? That's a pent-up demand. Now, that's my opinion."
2342,2020-04-05,"The other thing is we're doing tremendous stimulus plans. And despite what you're reading — you know, there's back and forth, but we are getting along with the Democrats. They want to see something happen. We have to help our workers. We have to help our small businesses. We have to help — we have to help our restaurants. I think deductibility will be great for entertainment, restaurants, all of it."
2343,2020-04-05,"Look, I think, with the stimulus, with the people, with what we've got going, with all of the things — we're going to be meeting with the airlines over the weekend. We have a great plan for the airlines. We've got to keep the airlines going. You know, it's never been a great business, but it's a very vital business for the country."
2344,2020-04-05,"We're going to be meeting with Boeing. We're going to be meeting with a lot of companies that are great companies and were great companies a short while ago. I mean, we can't let anything happen to Boeing. It's, you know, got so much potential. You talk about potential — can anything have more potential than that?"
2345,2020-04-05,"So, we have a lot of very exciting things taking place. We have tremendous plans. We have tremendous stimulus. And I think we have a chance to do really well."
2346,2020-04-05,"So this quarter isn't the quarter I'm looking at. Third quarter, we start to think about it. And I think fourth quarter is going to be at a level that, maybe, we haven't seen before."
2347,2020-04-05,"I think our country — with the stimulus, with all that we've been through — we've learned a lot. Don't forget, we've learned about pandemics and epidemics. We've learned a tremendous amount. And with all that we've learned — as an example, we're making ventilators. We have thousands of them being delivered in the very near future. We have countries calling us: “Can we have ventilators?” That would have been an unthinkable call. I'd be — I wouldn't know what to say. They have people dying, but we needed them for ourselves. We have plenty before the surge. In New York, they need far fewer hospital rooms or far fewer hospital beds, in particular, than we thought."
2348,2020-04-05,"And I have to say, Dr. Birx told me that four weeks ago, six weeks ago. I remember you said, “That number is too high. We don't need that many.” And based on what she said, and others, we did what we had to do. We actually gave the maximum. We built Javits. We sent the ship in. We then made the ship COVID, because, you know, there weren't a lot of people on the roads; you didn't have the accidents that we thought — other unrelated accidents. There's nobody driving. You know, normally you have a lot of car accidents. You have a lot of motorcycle accidents. You have people going to the hos- — we didn't have that. We had almost none of it. So, a lot of things have happened."
2349,2020-04-05,"I think we have a chance to be stronger than before. I really do. I think the stimulus is very important. What we're doing — I think it's very, very important."
2350,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
2351,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2352,2020-04-05,"Well, it's something that we've already suggested. We're talking to them. Business interruption insurance. I'd like to see these insurance companies — you know, you have people that have paid — when I was in private, I had business interruption."
2353,2020-04-05,"When my business was interrupted through a hurricane or whatever it may be, I'd have business where I had it. I didn't always have it. Sometimes I had it; sometimes I have a lot of different companies. But if I had it, I'd expect to be paid. You have people — I speak mostly to the restauranteurs, where they have a restaurant, they've been paying for 25, 30, 35 years — business interruption. They've never needed it. All of a sudden, they need it. And I'm very good at reading language. I did very well in these subjects. Okay? And I don't see the word “pandemic” mentioned."
2354,2020-04-05,"Now, in some cases, it is. It's an exclusion. But in a lot of cases, I don't see it. I don't see a reference, and they don't want to pay up. I would like to see the insurance companies pay if they need to pay, if it's fair. And they know what's fair and I know what's fair. I can tell you very quickly."
2355,2020-04-05,"But business interruption insurance, that's getting a lot of money to a lot of people. And they've been paying for years. You know, sometimes they just started paying. But you have people that have never asked for business interruption insurance, and they've been paying a lot of money for a lot of years for the privilege of having it. And then when they finally need it, the insurance company says, “We're not going to give it.” We can't let that happen."
2356,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
2357,2020-04-05,"Well, there's not a lot of issues with this."
2358,2020-04-05,Yeah. I got it. There's not a lot. And it's a good question. There's not a lot of issues with testing.
2359,2020-04-05,"Certain sections of the — if we go to Iowa, we go to Nebraska, we go — and interestingly, Idaho is very interesting because they had a few breakouts, small breakouts. But they're very, very capable states and they're big distances. A lot of land. A lot of opening. You don't need testing there, you know, where you have a state with a small number of cases. Some states with almost none. West Virginia hung in for a long time, as you know, with none — for a long time."
2360,2020-04-05,"So when you have that, you don't need testing. You don't have to test every person in the state of Iowa, as an example. You don't have to test every single person to say, “Let's open up and let's get the tractors moving, and let's get the corn,” and let's open up all of the different things they do in that great state. You don't need that."
2361,2020-04-05,"With that being said, if there's a little hot corner someplace, we'll be testing. But I think Deborah speaks to this very well. Same thing in New York. That's what we talked to Governor Cuomo about this morning. We have the Abbott test, which is very quick and very easy. It goes very fast. Then we have a lesser test that we talked about where we can talk about a larger area."
2362,2020-04-05,"But you're going to know — so we're going to do testing, but you don't need to test 325 to 350 million people, because, number one, it's unnecessary. Vast numbers — vast areas of our country don't need this. I think you agree with me on that. You just don't need it."
2363,2020-04-05,"Now, we have certain hotspots. So, Louisiana is a hotspot. New York is a hotspot. Detroit is a hotspot. And then you have certain areas in certain hotspots that you have to even go more so. And we're doing all of that."
2364,2020-04-05,Remember this: We've done more testing than any country in the world. And we have the best tests. And we've developed this over a very short period of time.
2365,2020-04-05,Please. Go ahead.
2366,2020-04-05,Yes.
2367,2020-04-05,Sure.
2368,2020-04-05,"Well, we do have a plan. And one of the things I'm most proud about is what I've been able to do for the African American community: the lowest job numbers in the history of our country. This was —"
2369,2020-04-05,"Excuse me. Yeah. Just before the virus came — well, I'm just saying, because you know, this has been here for three weeks, right? So, just before, African American community had the lowest unemployment, the best employment numbers. More African American people and communities have been thriving."
2370,2020-04-05,"If you look at our Opportunity Zones and what we did — Tim Scott, who's fantastic, a fantastic senator, came to me: Opportunity Zones. More jobs for African Americans than ever before. Better healthcare than they've ever had before. All of these things."
2371,2020-04-05,"The Surgeon General spoke to it, and he spoke to it, I thought, really brilliantly. I found it very interesting what he said. And I'd love you to come up and answer the second part of her question because I think you're — you would do a much better job than I would."
2372,2020-04-05,Please.
2373,2020-04-05,Thank you. Thank you very much.
2374,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2375,2020-04-05,Would you like to add anything to it? Because you are really — you expressed it very beautifully before.
2376,2020-04-05,"And I can tell you Jerome has done a fantastic job — our Surgeon General. I just hope nobody steals him and he goes to one of these big companies for a fortune. Don't leave us. Right? Don't leave us, Jerome. Please."
2377,2020-04-05,He's doing a great — you are happy and you're doing a great job. And everybody — everybody tells me that too. So we appreciate it.
2378,2020-04-05,Please.
2379,2020-04-05,"Well, that's individual freedoms, problems and —"
2380,2020-04-05,— a lot of other things. Is it something we're going to look at it? Certainly. And we know they've done that. And it's highly — it's very new. New technology. It's very interesting. But a lot of people worry about it in terms of a person's freedom. We're going to take a look at that. A very strong look at it. We'll let you know pretty soon.
2381,2020-04-05,"Brand new. Yes, please."
2382,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to talk about the WHO next week in great detail. I didn't want to do it today — Good Friday. I didn't want to do it before Easter. I also didn't want to do it before we have all the facts."
2383,2020-04-05,"But over the years, many years, we've been paying them from 300 to 500, and even more, million dollars a year. China has been paying them less than 40 over the years. So we're paying them more than 10 times more than China. And they are very, very China-centric, as I said during the week. China-centric."
2384,2020-04-05,"China always seems the to get the better of the — the argument, and I don't like that. I really don't like that. I don't think that's appropriate. I don't think it's fair to the American people. And, you know, I tell that to President Xi. I tell that to Dr. Tedros. I spoke to him one time. I think he's a very nice man. I liked him."
2385,2020-04-05,"But we're going to be talking about that next week in great detail. We're looking at it very, very closely. We want to make sure money is properly spent."
2386,2020-04-05,"But again, why is the United States paying $500 million a year? It's a lot. And why is — okay? That's a lot. And why is China paying — last year, this year — $42 million? But generally under $40 [million]. So it's in the 30s."
2387,2020-04-05,"So we're at 500, 452, 400, 401 — different amounts, different years. And they're at 40, 38, 36, 35, 32, 31."
2388,2020-04-05,"No, no. But — but you have to ask yourself that question. And then the answer always turns out to be in China's favor. Well, I have the same thing with the World Trade. Isn't it interesting? World Trade. So we have World Health and we have World Trade. So we have the World Trade Organization. And until I came along, we were losing cases — so many cases. It was ridiculous. We were always losing these cases. I mean, almost every case. And now we're winning cases. We just won $7 billion because they know I'm not going to put up with it."
2389,2020-04-05,"China has been — unbelievably taken advantage of us and other countries. You know, for instance, they're considered a developing nation. I said, “Well, then make us a developing nation too.” They get big advantages because they're a developing nation. India, a developing nation. The United States is the big developed nation. Well, we have plenty of development to do. Okay?"
2390,2020-04-05,"And now we're winning cases because they know that if we're not treated fairly, I'm going to pull out. Now, you never heard this before because nobody ever talked about the World Trade Organization. But the World Trade Organization has treated us very unfairly. But they know I'm not going to put up with it because all of these countries are taking advantage of the United States."
2391,2020-04-05,"Now, in the courts and the court system, we're not approving new judges over the last year. We're not going to approve them. And Bob Lighthizer is working very hard on that."
2392,2020-04-05,"But we had always a minority position, meaning numbers of judges. So we'd have a minority number of judges. I said, “How do you win with a minority number of judges?” But all of a sudden, we're winning. And the reason we're winning is they know if they don't treat us properly — and we won $7 billion just this very recently. And the money is pouring in. And we won other cases too. We won a lot of cases."
2393,2020-04-05,But you know from covering it — I know you know — that the United States was taken advantage of by the World Trade Organization.
2394,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, speaking of China: If you look at the history of China, it was only since they went into the World Trade Organization that they became a rocket ship with their economy. They were flat-lined for years and years. Frankly, for many, many decades. And it was only when they came into the World Trade Organization that they became a rocket ship because they took advantage of all there is. I'm not even blaming them. I'm saying, how stupid were the people that stood here and allowed it to happen? But we don't allow that to happen. And if they don't treat us fairly, we'll leave. But now we're starting to win cases."
2395,2020-04-05,How about somebody new for a change? Come on.
2396,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
2397,2020-04-05,"Well, I have a lot of confidence in Ron DeSantis, a lot of faith in Ron DeSantis to make the right decision. He's doing a great job as governor. Ron DeSantis, I had read where he's thinking about opening up the schools earlier than the date — the end of the month. I'd have to look at the numbers."
2398,2020-04-05,"But again, you know, I like to allow governors to make decisions without overruling them, because from a constitutional standpoint, that's the way it should be done. If I disagreed, I would overrule a governor, and I have that right to do it. But I'd rather have them — you can call it “federalist,” you can call it “the Constitution,” but I call it “the Constitution.” I would rather have them make their decisions."
2399,2020-04-05,"But he's made a lot of good decisions. And he hasn't said he's going to, but he's thinking about it. So I'll take a look at it."
2400,2020-04-05,"Well, I think the answer is obvious, but if you want, either — would you want to just talk about that maybe? Tony?"
2401,2020-04-05,I know. I can see. (Laughs.) I think — I think they know the answer to that.
2402,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
2403,2020-04-05,"Depending on the outbreak, yeah. Depending."
2404,2020-04-05,"And that's happened, as you know, with a couple of countries."
2405,2020-04-05,"You know what I'm doing? I'm watching other countries. In many cases, they're ahead of us from the standpoint that it attacked them before us. It hit them first. And I'm watching what's happening with respect to certain other countries — some of them obvious, some of them less obvious — and what they're doing and the success that they're having. And that's going to play a large part of the role."
2406,2020-04-05,"I'm also — we're also setting up a council of very, very great doctors and business people. We're going to be announcing it on Tuesday — of some great people. The —"
2407,2020-04-05,"Beyond — this is beyond economic. This is really — I call it, “The Opening Our Country Task Force” or “Opening Our Country Council,” so we don't get it confused with Mike's task force, which has done so great. And we're going to have the great business leaders, great doctors. We're going to have a great group of people."
2408,2020-04-05,"We'll probably do it by teleconference, because we don't really want them traveling in, for their own purposes. I don't think it would look good, also. But we don't want them traveling in. So we'll do teleconference."
2409,2020-04-05,"We did one the other day with the banks, and it was very successful — the teleconference itself."
2410,2020-04-05,"And we'll be announcing names on Tuesday, who's on that. And that'll play a role. But ultimately, I have to make that decision. And then I'll have to make a decision: Do we close a little area that's a hotspot?"
2411,2020-04-05,"I do say this, Jim: I want to get it open as soon as possible. This country was meant to be open and vibrant and great, not where people are, you know, staying in."
2412,2020-04-05,"No, I'm not — I am — I would love to open it. I'm not determined anything. The facts are going to determine what I do. But we do want to get the country open. So important."
2413,2020-04-05,"So I'll have a task force. I'll have a council. It's going to be announced on Tuesday with names that you have a lot of respect for, a lot of great names. Different businesses, different people. Top —"
2414,2020-04-05,"Bipartisan? I didn't even ask. I mean, honestly, I think it's bipartisan. The one thing I didn't ask, “Are you Republican or a Democrat?” Hard to believe, but I didn't ask. So it would be. And I want their views on what they think."
2415,2020-04-05,"Also, very important, different parts of the country. Because if you go to the Midwest, it's different than perhaps the East Coast or the West Coast. Now, the West Coast, those numbers are, really, pretty amazing on the West Coast. It's very interesting."
2416,2020-04-05,So we're going to be announcing that in a very short while. Probably Tuesday.
2417,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
2418,2020-04-05,"Well, what we're doing — we have a tremendous force out there — a naval force — and we're blocking the shipment of drugs. So maybe what they're doing is stopping ships that they want to look. We're not blocking. What we're doing is we're making sure — we don't want drugs in our country. And especially with the over 160 miles of wall — it's getting very hard to get through the border. They used to drive right through the border like they owned it, and in a certain way, they did. They could drive right — they had human trafficking. They had — all of a sudden, they have a powerful wall up, and they're not driving through that wall. That wall is tough and it's also loaded up with equipment — cameras and sensors and everything you can think of. On top of that, we have drones flying back and forth over it. So — so it's in very — a very powerful — it's a very powerful barrier between Mexico and the United States."
2419,2020-04-05,"A lot of people though — what they're doing now is they're trying to come in through the waterways, whether it's the Gulf or the ocean itself. And what we're doing is we're being very tough. And we're being tough because of drugs and also human trafficking."
2420,2020-04-05,"And remember, the human trafficking is mostly females. It's mostly females. It's horrible. And what we're seeing is horrible. But you have a big — we have a human trafficking — human trafficking problem worldwide, the likes of which — you know, you think of it as an ancient thing. It's not ancient. It's bigger now than it's ever been before, over the last 10 years, because of the Internet. The Internet made human trafficking to the extent that it is now, which is massive. The Internate [sic] — the Internet made it so big."
2421,2020-04-05,"So, we are — we have a big naval force that's stopping. So maybe when you mention that, maybe their ships are getting caught. But we are — we're stopping a lot of ships, and we're finding a lot of drugs."
2422,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
2423,2020-04-05,"Well, I meant you, but that's okay. Go head. We'll do this."
2424,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
2425,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2426,2020-04-05,You're talking about the new —
2427,2020-04-05,"Yeah, 250."
2428,2020-04-05,"I'd rather have that be in phase four. I don't deny it; I think it's fine. But I think it should be in phase four. And I think we should have infrastructure, and I think we should have a payroll tax moratorium, because that's something that, over a period of time, the workers get, you know, sort of semi-immediately. It's over that period of time. It starts immediately, but it's over a period of time."
2429,2020-04-05,"I mean, there are a lot of people — I'm one of them — that would have liked to have seen the payroll tax cut as a permanent cut. But we should do the double-edged — meaning, business-employee payroll tax cut. So we're talking about that."
2430,2020-04-05,"And I'm certainly okay with helping the states and helping the hospitals. I just think — because, look, the hospitals need help; you see what they've gone through. And the states need help. Some states in particular need help. They need big help. I'm willing to look at that very strongly. But I like looking at it in phase four."
2431,2020-04-05,"The 251 is actually — the plan is working out well. The banks are getting started with the distribution. They've taken hund- — thousands and thousands of applications. The numbers aren't even believable, the number of applications. They're swamped. But Bank of America and Wells Fargo, and, I guess, Citi — Citibank is just now kicking in."
2432,2020-04-05,"And also what nobody is talking about, the commercial banks — the community banks. Everyone is talking commercial banks. The community banks are doing tremendous volumes. And they're probably doing them faster, from what I understand. I hear the community banks, frankly, are the easiest ones in terms of getting the money out."
2433,2020-04-05,"So the money is getting out. The applications are far beyond what we ever anticipated. And that's what we're — that's why we're going. Because this is money that goes, essentially, to the workers. We want the businesses to hold on to their workers, because once they lose the workers, they're never opening again. It's not going to happen."
2434,2020-04-05,"Okay, in the back."
2435,2020-04-05,"Well, there's no real cost because we're agreeing to produce a little bit less. So, number one, it's staying in the ground. You have it. You have it for another day. It's actually cheaper than storing it, where you take it out and you deliver it to a massive well, like the Strategic Reserves — our National Strategic Reserves where it has to be brought there. And that's, you know, an expensive process in itself."
2436,2020-04-05,"But oil is getting to a point where, I mean, there are some areas — some people would say the water is more valuable than the oil. You never thought you're going to see that. You never thought having covered — I know you cover it — you never thought you'd be seeing oil at $20 a barrel, but how about $10 a barrel? That, you never thought you'd see."
2437,2020-04-05,"So we are looking at it very strongly. There is no real cost. I was helping Mex- — I want to help Mexico out. We have a great relationship with Mexico, a great relationship with the President. I really like him a lot. He's been terrific to us on the border because he stopped — he stopped — you don't see the caravans coming up anymore. You don't see all the problems. When I took office, it was unbelievable what was going on."
2438,2020-04-05,"And they are really — they have been helping us a lot, and we've been helping them a lot. You know, they make product for us, they sell it to us, and it's fine. It's a good relationship. It's — and sometimes it's a great relationship."
2439,2020-04-05,"So, he could not have done any more than that. And I think there was political reasons for that — for him — that other — other nations don't have. They don't have that. You know, the nations that we're talking about — the 22 other nations that we're talking about — they just don't have that problem."
2440,2020-04-05,"So, it doesn't cost us anything, and yet it's very valuable. We will be reimbursed in the future — maybe in the near future, maybe in the more distant future. But we'll be reimbursed by Mexico in a certain way, and it'll be fine. But we get Mexico over the hump."
2441,2020-04-05,"Now with all of that being said, that doesn't mean the deal is going to happen anyway, because they still have a lot of different states. But this was one of the stumbling blocks. Okay?"
2442,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
2443,2020-04-05,"Well, look, the way I view it is this: China has taken advantage of the United States for 30 years. Okay? I mentioned the World Trade Organization. China has taken advantage of us through that and using rules that are unfair to the United States. And they should have never been allowed — this should have never been allowed to happen."
2444,2020-04-05,"When China joined and was allowed to join under those circumstances — the World Trade Organization — that was a very bad day for the United States because they had rules and regulations that were far different and far easier than our rules and regulations. Plus, they took advantage of them down to the last — and you know China and you studied China and you know what I mean. They took advantage of them like very few people would even think to take advantage of them."
2445,2020-04-05,"And again, they are considered — right? — a developing nation. We are not considered a developing nation. They've given advantages. Okay."
2446,2020-04-05,"For many years, China has ripped off the United States. And then I came along. And right now, as you know, China is paying 25 percent, and we've taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China. And I know a lot of the people kept saying, “Oh, no. We're paying.” Well, we're not paying. You know, countries are different. Not every country is China. But China would devalue their currency, and they'd also pour out money. And they, essentially, were paying most of those tariffs, not us."
2447,2020-04-05,"And, as you know, we've taken in tens of billions of dollars. They targeted our farmers. But we took in so much money that I was able to give back. One year it was $12 billion. One year was $16 billion. I was able to give back our farmers the money that they were targeted — hurt."
2448,2020-04-05,"China bought $12 billion and bought $16 billion — one year, 12; one year, 16. I was able to give them back the 12, and then give them back the 16 — the farmers. And they weren't targeted, and they're all in business. Now we're doing it because they got targeted in a different way."
2449,2020-04-05,"Now, I'm going to be very interested to see. So we signed a deal with China. And under that deal, they're supposed to buy substantially in excess of $200 billion from us. That's not only farm product, it's manufacturing product, it's lots of different things. They're going to buy a lot. I just want to see if they live up to that deal."
2450,2020-04-05,I know President Xi. I would say he would live up to the deal. But remember this: I never took off the tariff. It's still 25 percent. That's a big — 25 percent of $250 billion dollars.
2451,2020-04-05,"So, for the first time — and you saw also — now again, I'm going before the virus hit. Because that's sort of like — that's like, “Let's start all over again.” Okay? I can't tell you that yet, because that chapter hasn't been written yet. But go up a few weeks ago, the deficit with the United States and China was coming way down. Nobody has seen that. Nobody has ever seen that before. But the deficit has come way down."
2452,2020-04-05,"So, now we start a new chapter. And I can only tell you, if a smart person is standing where I'm standing, we're going to do very well with China. Okay?"
2453,2020-04-05,"And I think it's — I have to also say this: I think our relationship, and having the relationship I have with China is a good thing. But for the first time, we're benefiting instead of being the sucker that could — you know, that got taken advantage of for years. Nobody."
2454,2020-04-05,"You know, I said to China, “How did this ever happen?” I got to know them very well. I said to them — representatives of China at the top level, you know who I'm talking about — I say, “How did this ever happen?” They looked at me and they said, “But nobody ever called us.” We didn't have a deal. It's not like we had a bad deal. We had worse: We didn't have any deal at all, so they just took advantage."
2455,2020-04-05,"Think of it: $500-billion-a-year deficit. Not — $500 million is a lot of money, right? It's not — everyone thinks I've made a mistake when I say “$500 trillion.” “No, you mean $500 million.” “No, I said 500-billion-dollar-a-year deficit with China for a long time.” But it was 200. It was 300. It was 400. It was 500 — 556 billion, 507. Five-hundred-billion-dollars-plus-a-year deficit with China. Now I'm charging them tariffs."
2456,2020-04-05,"And, you know, it's very interesting. A lot of people that don't want to do that — they all agreed because China has taken advantage of this country like nobody has ever taken. We have built China with the money we gave them."
2457,2020-04-05,"Now, I give them a lot of credit. Okay? I give them a lot of credit. They did it. But you know what? We made it a hell of a lot easier. We gave them a fortune."
2458,2020-04-05,Go ahead. How about you in the back? Yes.
2459,2020-04-05,Good.
2460,2020-04-05,"Sure. Go ahead. A little louder, please."
2461,2020-04-05,Have I been tested for antibodies?
2462,2020-04-05,Not that I know of. I've had some tests.
2463,2020-04-05,No? They tell me “no.” I'll accept it.
2464,2020-04-05,That'll come out. They've just developed those tests. They're sort of new.
2465,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Well, the aid hasn't been given yet. But they will be asking, in my opinion. They haven't even asked yet. Boeing has not asked for aid yet. But I think they probably will."
2466,2020-04-05,"Now, at the same time, they do have to run a company. You know, this isn't a great time to sell airplanes. Let's not kid ourselves, okay? If you're a businessperson. Boeing makes airplanes. They had a big problem with one, but they make the greatest airplanes. They make the best airplanes in the world. They had the problem with one. They got it too complex. It becomes so complex you have to be number one in your class at MIT to be able to fly it. It's a mistake. Every two years, they want to make it more and more."
2467,2020-04-05,"I mean, they had great success with the 737 — the Boeing 737. Then, all of a sudden, they do the Max. And they say, “Let's make it more complicated. Let's put on different engines. Let's do this. Let's do that.” It was not exactly a good decision. A bad decision. Very, bad — a horrible decision. Number one, human lives. And number two, horrible what's happened to the company."
2468,2020-04-05,"Here's a company — from a business standpoint, it was like probably the greatest company in the world, in my opinion. I think it amounts to 1 percent of GDP. Some people say it's a half. I think it's 1. But here's one of the greatest companies anyway in the world. Maybe, the greatest. And boom."
2469,2020-04-05,"Now, on top of what happened there with the two planes — and they say they have that fixed. That's good. They say they have it fixed undisputably. In fact, somebody said — they gave me something — I said, “You should say it that way.” They said, “Sir, this is now the safest airplane in the air.” I said — “That's what you should say. That's a very good statement: It's the safest airplane in the air. That's a very good statement. You should use it.” I said, “By the way, are you changing the name? But whether you do or not, you should use that.” But he said that. A Boeing person said to me, “It's the safest airplane in the air.” That's a great thing."
2470,2020-04-05,"But we know they're going to need help. Now, does that mean they're going to need help, and they should keep people that they absolutely don't need? That business is a very cyclical business, like many businesses, frankly. So that determination hasn't been made. They have not spoken to us, yet. I think they will be. Maybe they won't need help. That'll be great."
2471,2020-04-05,"Look, Boeing made so much money — who would've — who would've thought they could have made all of those planes that are parked all over the place? In many cases, I guess payment is not made. But who would have thought they could do that and they're still a solvent company, okay? I mean, what a tragic thing — happened in numerous ways, but also economically."
2472,2020-04-05,"So, when they see us, making sure that Boeing is strong again is very, very powerful and very important. And we'll do whatever is necessary to do."
2473,2020-04-05,Please.
2474,2020-04-05,"Should we keep this going, everybody?"
2475,2020-04-05,"Jim wants to leave. (Laughter.) Keep it going for a while, yes?"
2476,2020-04-05,"If we have time, if you want. Should I — you're not going to criticize me that the conference was too long?"
2477,2020-04-05,"You know, if I leave short — yesterday, I left short. “It was too short.” If stay too long, they say, “It was too long.” Someday, we're going to get it just right. Okay. Should we continue?"
2478,2020-04-05,Should we continue? Yes?
2479,2020-04-05,Okay. Let's at least do your question. (Laughter.)
2480,2020-04-05,That's not a bad point.
2481,2020-04-05,"I have not. No. I have a call, just to wish him well to his — to his group. No, I don't want to be calling him now. I want him to get better."
2482,2020-04-05,"He's a great guy. He's become a friend of mine — a real friend of mine. You know, he has a great feeling for our country. For — obviously, for his country. He loves it. He's — he's a tremendous guy."
2483,2020-04-05,"He's become — I think, he's probably, right now — he was very high to start. I think he might be 100 percent popularity right now. I think he's — you know, when they talk about approval polls, right? You ever hear that term? I'm sure you never heard that. I hear it all the time. His approval rating must be about 300 percent."
2484,2020-04-05,But he's a — he's a great guy. He was a great guy before and I think people see what he's been through. What he has been through is incredible. And they say a “big turn.” So let's see what happens. Let's hope.
2485,2020-04-05,Something like — excuse me?
2486,2020-04-05,"Well, I see a lot of — yeah. I see a lot of different things. We're going — we have to be very careful for who comes into the country. Look, my opposition party wants to have open borders. This is a case where I'm very glad that my position is: I don't want open borders. I want very strong borders. That includes not only on the southern border — our southern border with Mexico, and you could also say our northern border with Canada — but we want to have strong borders."
2487,2020-04-05,"And, I think, this is maybe one of the learning points. We learned something about borders. We need borders. A country needs borders to be a great country. And this is, I think, this is a great point."
2488,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Do you have something else?
2489,2020-04-05,"You mean, once they get better?"
2490,2020-04-05,"Okay. So, they have the disease and they're better and they have the immunity now. They have — supposedly, according to what I am hearing, it could be for a long period. It could be for a lifetime. It could also be for a for a year or two, I'm hearing, Tony."
2491,2020-04-05,"So nobody has told me yet if it's for a year, if it's for two years, or if it's for a lifetime. Like chickenpox — they say if you have chickenpox, you have immunity, they say, for a lifetime. I hope that's true."
2492,2020-04-05,"But — but nobody has actually told me with certainty, maybe because they don't know yet —"
2493,2020-04-05,"You don't know yet. Because it's new. You know, this came upon us. Nobody knew. We just — we're just — they do know you have it for a period of time and it's strong for a period of time. They don't know — and that's, hence the antibodies that we're making."
2494,2020-04-05,"I saw somebody who was really sick, and he got better — a young person, a relatively young person — 35 and physically fit, you know. And he — he got better. He made it. Barely, but he made it. His first thing that he did when he was better is, “I want to give — I want to give whatever I can give to help other people because nobody should go through it.” It's a tough — it's a tough thing."
2495,2020-04-05,So we don't know yet how long — if you'd like to add anything to that. But we don't know yet. Is it a year? It will be a year. But is it more than a year? And only time is going to tell. Okay? Thank you.
2496,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Try one more.
2497,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I think so. I think we're going to put some governors. I've gained great respect for governors, both Republican and Democrat. I've actually become friends with some of the Democrat governors that I wouldn't have really had the privilege of getting to know."
2498,2020-04-05,"And Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a very liberal guy. I'm not. But we've had a great relationship. John Bel, as you know — I call him “John Bel” — John Bel Edwards. People call him “John Bel.” It's sort of a cool name — from Louisiana. I have a very good relationship with him."
2499,2020-04-05,"Gavin Newsom. Honestly, I think we've fight on every — hey, we're fighting right now. I want automobiles to be made cheaper and safer and stronger. And — but you save three, four thousand dollars per automobile. And environmentally equal, or better, maybe. And we're fighting on that. We're fighting a lot of different things. We fight on the border. He wants open borders. I want — I want people to come into our country legally. But I've gotten very friendly with Gavin Newsom. He's done a very good job here."
2500,2020-04-05,"I think I've gotten very friendly. I mean, he's been, I think, sort of a friend of mine for a long time. Don't get to see him much. But Governor Cuomo of New York — we talk all the time. I told you, I spoke to him literally the last call, just before walking in here."
2501,2020-04-05,"I've gotten to — I've really developed a lot of good friendships with the governors and, including governors of (inaudible.) I think — Mike DeWine, Republican, but I think he's done a great job in Ohio."
2502,2020-04-05,"So, yeah, I want to put on both parties. I want to have some governors. I'm not going to have all of the governors, but I'd like to put some representative governors on the council. Yes, I would like to do that."
2503,2020-04-05,"I have. I've asked a couple of them. They've all said yes. So far, everyone said yes. I think everybody would like to be on that council. That's a very important council."
2504,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, in the back. You haven't gone yet."
2505,2020-04-05,You're going to have to say it louder. To those what?
2506,2020-04-05,"Oh, the pastors. I didn't understand your word. Okay, you have a very nice voice but it's a little bit low, and you're far back."
2507,2020-04-05,"I've had talks with the pastors, and most of the pastors agree — and this is a very complex subject, let's face it, you know, for the obvious reasons. I don't have to go into it. And most of the pastors agree that they are better off doing what they're doing, which is distancing. They feel that, “Let's get this over with,” and they want to get back to church so badly."
2508,2020-04-05,"I mean, can you imagine? We have Easter Sunday and I'm going to be watching Pastor Robert Jeffress, who's been a great guy, that I tell you. He's been a great guy, and I'm going to be watching on a laptop. Now, a laptop is not the same as being in his church or being in another church. It's not, no matter what you say. You know, we can say, “Oh, isn't it wonderful?”"
2509,2020-04-05,"But I've done this for three weeks, and they've had tremendous — I let people know who it is. They've had the biggest audiences they've ever had. They have millions of people now watching, and people are really liking what they're hearing."
2510,2020-04-05,"So I'm going to be with, on Easter, Pastor — I don't even know if he knows it yet, but he will soon. I think he will in about two minutes. Pastor Robert Jeffress. And he's a terrific guy, a terrific man. I've gotten to know him very well. He's a man of great compassion. He loves our country. And I'm going to be with him on Easter — meaning I'm going to be with him, watching on a laptop. Doesn't sound good, but it's, you know, it's one of those things — it cannot be church. You know, I'm not going to get into it. It cannot be church."
2511,2020-04-05,"Most pastors and most people of faith — people that we listen to and respect and admire. Franklin Graham is a person I have great respect for. Most people will — and who's done an incredible job in New York on Central Park, where they put up Samaritan's Purse. He's done an incredible job."
2512,2020-04-05,"The son of the late, great Billy Graham. His family is incredible. He's incredible. Franklin Graham, the job he's doing on — I mean, he loves to do it. He has such a passion. And that's why he's so good at it. He does it with — with incredible love."
2513,2020-04-05,"And he will tell you — we're all saying, “We've got to get our country cured.” I know there are some pastors and ministers and others that want to get together. I would — and I have great respect for them. Two of them I know."
2514,2020-04-05,But I would say first heal — I'm a Christian — heal our country. Let's get healed before we do this. And there's time to do that. We'll do it for hopefully the rest of our lives.
2515,2020-04-05,Please.
2516,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2517,2020-04-05,Yes.
2518,2020-04-05,"Yeah. So the Mercy and the Comfort were sent when projections were much higher. And I say it — Tony backed it up, Deborah made the statement — they said you're not going to need these many rooms, but we wanted to be prepared. I mean, you know, we had the ship. They did an incredible job with — the Comfort was supposed to be in maintenance for a period of four weeks and they hadn't done in three and a half, four days. And it came up. And so we had it there."
2519,2020-04-05,"If there was a disaster from the standpoint of you needed all of the — now, I'll tell you, the Javits Center — Andrew will tell you, we were ready to go. It's incredible, the job they did. But they're — they're using less beds. This is a good thing, not a bad thing. They're using less beds."
2520,2020-04-05,"Now, Javits has been pretty busy over the last couple of days. And the death numbers are horrific. But you go back now and you're finding they're going to start to come down very substantially just based on the fact that the bed usage, the number of beds are much, much less. Much, much less."
2521,2020-04-05,"So the Mercy and the Comfort were there in case they needed them. Los Angeles, where you have the one and New York where you the other, they just don't — fortunately, we haven't hit numbers where they would have need, they would have been used. They're always going to be sort of overflow because they're on the edges. You know, they're not as convenient as certain places. But the people were ready, willing, and able. They were ready to go. They were going to do a great job."
2522,2020-04-05,"But fortunately we don't need — just like we didn't need as many ventilators. When they were asking in New York for 40,000 ventilators, I had experts — these people, I listened to them — they said you'll never need that many. And they were right. And New York now has it's — and I dealt really well Mayor de Blasio. We got him a lot of ventilators. We got Andrew a lot of ventilators. But we never felt you needed the numbers that you were talking about and we were right on that."
2523,2020-04-05,"Now, with all of that being said, we have a lot of ventilators ready to go. We have almost 10,000 in the stockpile. That 10,000 can move rapidly. We can be within 24 hours almost anywhere. And hopefully we're not going to have to be but it's just — it's really — this has been a great military operation. It hasn't all been military because we're dealing with great companies. We have companies that are making masks. We're — and we're all set up in the masks too."
2524,2020-04-05,"I just told you we have an order coming in soon: 500 million masks. 500 million. We have companies — you know the story with GM — or 3M — also GM, but 3M is doing a great job. I spoke to the CEO the other day. We settled it out. We had a dispute with them. And it's now all settled. And I think they're trying to show the country something — maybe me, but the country something."
2525,2020-04-05,"So, we've done, you know, I think — and not me. I'm not talking about me. This country, our country, the people that are doing it: Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, these people sitting right here, people that we have in the back that are watching every word that we're saying — they've done a fantastic job. They really have done a fantastic job."
2526,2020-04-05,Please.
2527,2020-04-05,"Well, what do we have —"
2528,2020-04-05,What do we have? 350 million people? You're going to do $350- —
2529,2020-04-05,"Well, you're asking that because of what happened — it's a fair question, too — what happened in Denver. Because in Denver, I've never seen — I said, “What's going on?” We're looking at this graph where everything's looking beautiful and it's coming down and then you got this one spike. It's — I said, “What happened to Denver?”"
2530,2020-04-05,"And many people, very quickly, and they — by the way, they were on it like, so fast, you wouldn't believe it. They knew every aspect. They had people go and — not only testing, “Who did you see? Where were you? How many people did you meet? Were you out to dinner in somebody else's home? Where were you?” Where did — where did this number of people come from? How did — they are totally on it."
2531,2020-04-05,"Now, this just happened. I just saw it this morning. I'm looking at everything smooth, going down, topping out. And then you have this one spike in Denver. It's like, where did this come from?"
2532,2020-04-05,So we'll be looking at that. And we don't want cases like that happening. This was — but this — this is the kind of thing can happen. This is very complex.
2533,2020-04-05,"This is a very brilliant enemy. You know, it's a brilliant enemy. They develop drugs like the antibiotics. You see it. Antibiotics used to solve every problem. Now one of the biggest problems the world has is the germ has gotten so brilliant that the antibiotic can't keep up with it. And they're constantly trying to come up with a new — people go to a hospital and they catch — they go for a heart operation — that's no problem, but they end up dying from — from problems. You know the problems I'm talking about. There's a whole genius to it."
2534,2020-04-05,"We're fighting — not only is it hidden, but it's very smart. Okay? It's invisible and it's hidden, but it's — it's very smart. And you see that in a case like a Denver."
2535,2020-04-05,"But, you know, I think we're doing well, and they're on Denver like you wouldn't believe. I came in this morning; it was a flurry. I said what's going on? They said, “Denver.” I said, “What happened to Denver?” Because Denver was doing pretty well. And they've got that under control. But, yeah, that would be a case where you do some very big testing."
2536,2020-04-05,Peter.
2537,2020-04-05,"Number one, I love them. Number two, we're working really hard. It wasn't their fault, what happened. Sometimes they don't do a good job and they lose their job. That's one thing. This is a case where we take the strongest economy in the history of the world, which is what we had. More people working in the United States, Peter, than ever before. Almost — I mean, look at the numbers: 160 million people, almost. Just short of 160."
2538,2020-04-05,Excuse me.
2539,2020-04-05,"So, we have the greatest economy we've ever had. And, by the way, black unemployment, Hispanic unemployment, Asian unemployment — the best numbers we've ever had in virtually every way. And then you get hit like this, and it's traumatic."
2540,2020-04-05,"People that had great jobs, that went out to dinner, and they didn't have any problems, they'd take their family, they were making good salaries, all of a sudden — you know, you use the term, “cold turkey.” It's cold turkey. They go from that to having no money and waiting for their checks, which are being processed very rapidly. But they still — they have to go out and look for money."
2541,2020-04-05,"It's a terrible thing. All I say is: We love them, we're working so hard, and they're going to be back. And I hope they're going to be back even stronger than before."
2542,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Yeah — no, it's really — the states can do things if they want. I can override it if I want. But the national stay-at-home — just so you understand, 95 percent of the country is stay-at-home."
2543,2020-04-05,"Like, as an example, I was speaking with the great governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, the other day. He has a stay-at-home. A lot of people didn't even know it, but he had a stay-at -home. Some people reported Texas wasn't. He had a very strong — actually, a very strong stay-at-home."
2544,2020-04-05,"Ninety-five to ninety-six percent in South Carolina, as you know, has it, which at one point, a week ago, they didn't have. South Carolina — another great governor — McMaster."
2545,2020-04-05,"No, 95 percent of the country is covered. Now, the states that aren't — and again, constitutionally, from a federalist standpoint, if I thought there was a problem, if I saw a state with a problem, I would absolutely demand it. But they're doing great. And the states that aren't are states that have not had a big problem."
2546,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I have — I have great authority if I want to use it. I would rather have the states use it. I would rather —"
2547,2020-04-05,"And this is so shocking for me. A lot of people are saying, “Wow, he's really very reasoned, isn't he?” A lot of people are shocked. They think I do a — I have absolute authority to use it. But, so far, our relationship with governors and the job they're doing, I haven't had to do it. Would I do it if I saw a state that was out of control and they didn't have the stay-at-home policy? I would do it in a heartbeat."
2548,2020-04-05,Jeff.
2549,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2550,2020-04-05,It's a very big decision.
2551,2020-04-05,"I don't know that I've had a bigger decision than that, when you think. Right?"
2552,2020-04-05,"I mean, think of that decision. Somebody said, “It's totally up to the President.” I saw it this morning. It's totally up — and it is. I don't know that I've had a bigger decision."
2553,2020-04-05,"But I'm going to surround myself with the greatest minds. Not only the greatest minds, but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason. And we're going to make a decision, and hopefully it's going to be the right decision."
2554,2020-04-05,"I will say this: I want to get it open as soon as we can. We have to get our country open, Jeff."
2555,2020-04-05,"The metrics right here. (Points to head.) That's my metrics. That's all I can do. I can listen to 35 people. At the end, I got to make a decision. And I didn't think of it until yesterday. I said, “You know, this is a big decision.” But I want to be guided. I'm going to be guided by them. I'm going to be guided by our Vice President. I'm going to make a decision based on a lot of different opinions. Some will maybe disagree, and some I'd love to see it where they don't disagree."
2556,2020-04-05,"Will there be risks? There's always going to be a risk that something can flare up. There's always going to — look, look at what's happening where countries are trying to get open and there's a flare-up and they'll go. But I'd like the flare-up to be very localized so that we can control it from a local standpoint without having to close."
2557,2020-04-05,"It's — it's — there's always a risk. This is a — this is genius that we're fighting. You know, we're fighting this hidden enemy, which is genius. Okay? It's genius, the way it's attacked so many countries at so many different angles. And — I mean, you take a look at what's going on."
2558,2020-04-05,"And the greatest doctors in the world — I think they're close, by the way, but they haven't figured it out yet. Look what it's done to some people. I mean, some people it's grabbed, and it's a — it's a horrible — it's a horrible way to go, if you want to know the truth. It's a horrible — and then other people, it hardly has an impact on. We talked about it; it's the sniffles. It's less. They don't even know they had anything."
2559,2020-04-05,"And some people — I looked at New York this morning, and I look at what's happening and the amount of people that are dying and dying — violently dying. It's — it's a — it's a very tough adversary. But we're going to win, and we're going to win it — we're going to win it very decisively."
2560,2020-04-05,"I'm going to have to make a decision, and I only hope to God that it's the right decision. But I would say, without question, it's the biggest decision I've ever had to make."
2561,2020-04-05,Want to answer that?
2562,2020-04-05,"I just want to say that, you know, you talked about, “Couldn't it lead to death,” meaning, if you open up, it could lead to death. And you're right."
2563,2020-04-05,"But you know what? Staying at home leads to death also. And it's very traumatic for this country. But staying at home — if you look at numbers — that leads to a different kind of death, perhaps, but it leads to death also. So it's a very big decision. As I say, it's the biggest decision I'll ever make."
2564,2020-04-05,"All right, we'll do a couple of more and we'll go. Thank you."
2565,2020-04-05,Yes.
2566,2020-04-05,"Well, you know, the other side seems to keep using that. And I have used it. You know, I've enacted it, you do know. And I've used it — some people thought viciously. Just ask a couple of companies. If you want, you can just look up the names."
2567,2020-04-05,"And I'm surprised that he would have said that. We actually have great tests. We have others under development. You don't need full testing, as the doctors have been talking about ad nauseam."
2568,2020-04-05,"So I would be surprised that he would have said that, meaning it that way. If he — if he did, I'd have a much different type answer."
2569,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
2570,2020-04-05,"We talked about testing, yeah. We did talk about testing. And one of the things I did was I put the two doctors in charge of that call. I said, “You know what, Andrew? I have two very talented people standing here. We're getting ready to go on. Let me put them and let me have them talk to you.” And they talked to him, really, at length. And I think by the time they finished, he understood what he was — what we were saying. He understood it very clearly. Okay?"
2571,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2572,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I understand."
2573,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I understand the question very well. Look, nobody has done to China, or treated China as strongly as I have. I use the word “strongly.” As you know — you've reported on it — billions and billions of dollars is flowing into our Treasury, because of what I've done with China."
2574,2020-04-05,"I think it's a very sad thing that happened. And I think if people knew, including the World Health Organization — and I do believe they knew, but they didn't want to tell the world. And we're going to get to the bottom of it. And we'll have reports on all of this. And we are — we are not happy about it, but I wanted to leave the World Health for later."
2575,2020-04-05,"And I can tell you that we're constantly in touch with China. We're talking to China. And we've expressed how we felt. We're not happy about it. We're not happy about it at all, Kristen."
2576,2020-04-05,"Okay, one or two more. Yeah, Jim."
2577,2020-04-05,No happy talk today.
2578,2020-04-05,"Why would you “no”? Look, the answer is “yes.”"
2579,2020-04-05,I think the answer is yes. I think the answer is yes. Who — who said no to that?
2580,2020-04-05,"No, no, you're saying no, but who said no?"
2581,2020-04-05,"But you asked, “Do we have enough masks?” Yes."
2582,2020-04-05,"No, you didn't say that. You said, “Do we have enough masks?” Yes."
2583,2020-04-05,"“Do we have enough tests?” Yes. Plus, we're developing new tests."
2584,2020-04-05,"“Do we have enough — do we have enough ventilators?” Yes. “Do we have enough hospital beds?” Yes. We've built 20,000 hospital beds. We have enough hospital beds."
2585,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Jim. Let's go."
2586,2020-04-05,You know what I say?
2587,2020-04-05,"Well, a lot of it's fake news."
2588,2020-04-05,A lot of it's fake news. A lot of it's fake news. Let me just tell you —
2589,2020-04-05,The governors — the governors reported —
2590,2020-04-05,"The governor — yeah, depending on your air, they always say that, because otherwise you're not going to put them on."
2591,2020-04-05,"Let me just tell you something: The governors have said — last night, they had a group of governors, 14 governors. They were together someplace, and they said, “It's been unbelievable what's happened.”"
2592,2020-04-05,"We've been totally responsive. Ventilators — everyone has the ventilators they need, to a point where we're getting calls from foreign countries saying, “You have all the ventilators. Can we get some? And we're going to try and help some of these countries."
2593,2020-04-05,"These people have done an incredible job. This is not happy talk. Maybe it's happy talk for you. It's not happy talk for me. We're talking about death. We're talking about the greatest economy in the world. One day I have to close it off. And we did the right thing, because maybe it would have been 2 million people died instead of whatever that final number will be, which could be 60, could be 70, could be 75, could be 55. Thousands of people have died. There's nothing happy about it, Jim. This is sad talk."
2594,2020-04-05,"This is the saddest — these are the saddest — these are the saddest news conferences that I've ever had. I don't like doing them. You know why? Because I'm talking about death. I'm talking about taking the greatest economy ever created — we had the greatest numbers we've ever had in almost every aspect of economics, from employment, to companies doing — look at the airlines. They were having the best year. Now, all of a sudden, we have to save them. Okay?"
2595,2020-04-05,"There's no happy talk, Jim. This is the real deal. And I've got to make the biggest decision of my life. And I've only started thinking about that. I mean, you know, I've made a lot of big decisions over my life. You understand that. This is, by far, the biggest decision of my life, because I have to say, “Okay, let's go. This is what we're going to do.”"
2596,2020-04-05,"Sure. But you have many doctors that say “unbelievable job.” I watched this morning, and I watched a certain network, and it wasn't Fox, and you had doctors saying that we've done an incredible job. You just read off these “no, no, no.” Well, we have ventilators. We have equipment. We have beds. How about beds? I mean, Governor Cuomo just told me, a little while ago, he's got plenty of beds. In fact, they're having a hard time filling Javits Center. We built them 2,900 beds."
2597,2020-04-05,So that's not a fair question.
2598,2020-04-05,"Jim, look — Jim."
2599,2020-04-05,Jim.
2600,2020-04-05,Jim.
2601,2020-04-05,"No, no. No, excuse me. We have masks. We have everything. And we were trying to get ready for the surge. And a lot of people said it will never happen. Deborah said it: “You'll never need that many beds.” They said we needed 40,000 ventilators. Forty thousand. It's like building a car. Forty thousand ventilators. People said — I felt it too. You'll never need that many."
2602,2020-04-05,"Guess what? We have tremendous — we have — we're the envy of the world, in terms of ventilators. Germany would like some. France would like some. We're going to help countries out. Spain needs them desperately. Italy needs them desperately. Mexico needs them desperately. He asked me last night, “Would it be possible to get 10,000 ventilators?” Within a short period of time, I'll be able to help out Mexico."
2603,2020-04-05,"No, Jim — just the opposite of your question. It's not, “No, no, no.” It's, “Yes, yes, yes.” We're in great shape. And you know what? What's happening now is those numbers are horrible, but take a look at the number of beds. We have beds available all over New York. New York really being the epicenter. New York — New York has experienced something that has been absolutely horrific."
2604,2020-04-05,"I saw Hart's Island yesterday. I saw those people being buried yesterday. Fortunately, we have the beds. And you can speak to Mayor de Blasio. You can speak to Governor Cuomo. People are — people can't even believe the job we've done. They can't even believe it."
2605,2020-04-05,"And I give tremendous credit to the military. This has been a military operation, with private people."
2606,2020-04-05,"But wait a minute — wait, wait. I give tremendous credit to our military, to the Army Corps of Engineers, to FEMA, to these people. The job they've done is incredible."
2607,2020-04-05,And you shouldn't be —
2608,2020-04-05,"— asking that kind of a question. Jim, honestly."
2609,2020-04-05,"Okay. Look, I really don't believe you're that bad of a guy."
2610,2020-04-05,"You shouldn't be asking that kind of a question. You should say, “You know what? It's been really incredible what's been happening.”"
2611,2020-04-05,"Jim, nobody is asking. What governor —"
2612,2020-04-05,Let me ask you this: What governor —
2613,2020-04-05,We have more tests than anybody in the world. We have every —
2614,2020-04-05,"We have virtually every country in the world calling us, asking us: “How do we get these tests that you have? Your testing is the best in the world. How do we get it? They've done a fantastic job.”"
2615,2020-04-05,"And when you ask a question like that, it's very insulting to a lot of great people."
2616,2020-04-05,"Okay, one more, please."
2617,2020-04-05,Please. Go ahead.
2618,2020-04-05,Sweden is different.
2619,2020-04-05,I think we could've followed that approach.
2620,2020-04-05,"And if we did follow that approach, I think we might have 2 million people dead. And Sweden is having a lot of difficulty. You know, look, I'm very friendly with the leadership in Sweden. They took a different approach. They're a very disciplined country to start off with, but they did take a different — and, you know, other places tried it."
2621,2020-04-05,"The UK tried it — the herd approach, okay? Herd. And they tried it, and you saw what happened in UK. It set them back a lot — a lot of time. It's been — you know, they're having a tough time. Other countries have tried it. And Sweden is suffering greatly. I mean, Sweden is suffering greatly."
2622,2020-04-05,"If we did the herd — if we went with the “herd,” as they say, we would have had potentially — I mean, you see the charts. Nobody knows. Nobody will ever know, fortunately. Because we're going to be substantially less than the minimum, I certainly hope, unless something happens. That would be tragic. So they had a minimum number, if we did."
2623,2020-04-05,"One of the reasons we're so far below that number is because nobody thought the American people could be so disciplined. Nobody thought it was possible. And, I guess, when they watched us up here every day, and they watched other people, and they listened to their representatives and governors — nobody thought that the American people could be so disciplined. They've been unbelievable."
2624,2020-04-05,"And because of that — so you have a minimum number of 100,000, and then you had the 2.2 number that, if we did nothing — if we did — just kept working, everybody go to work — people would be dropping dead on the subways. No."
2625,2020-04-05,"If we would have lost a million people — take the 2.2 million and cut it in half. Make it — cut it in more than half. Make it a million people, okay? Now take that number and cut it in half. Make it 500,000 people. That's if we did nothing, right? It's unacceptable. It's too many people."
2626,2020-04-05,"So we have — we've spent more money on stimulus. Who cares by comparison? You take 2.2, you cut it in half, you cut it in half, you cut it in half — you keep cutting it in half. I don't care what number you choose — 500,000, 400,000. Well, we're going to have — we're talking 50, 60, 65 [thousand]. Maybe. Maybe. But if we would have done what one country tried — and it has been very tough for them. You know that. Very, very nasty. Very tough. But if we would have done that here —"
2627,2020-04-05,"And again, you got to remember: UK tried it. And I was a little surprised. And I watched it. They were going about — what, two weeks? And they said, “We got to stop.” Because it was — they were going to have a whole country infected."
2628,2020-04-05,"So, with all of that being said, we got to get back to work. We got to get — we got to get our country open. But we could have lost 2 million people. We could have lost 1 million people. We could have lost a half a million people."
2629,2020-04-05,"If we would've lost 500,000 people — and I'll say this also: From the standpoint of being President and Vice President, and we're up there and we're doing that herd, and we're going to bullet through — do you honestly think people like Jim and yourself and other people would've — Jeff — would have put up with it, as people are dying all over? They would have said, “This man is crazy.” Because the numbers, Tony, at a minimum, would have been many, many times greater than the numbers we're talking about."
2630,2020-04-05,"So I'm very honored by our decisions, all of us. We talk about it all the time. I said, “Do you want to let them just –you just ride it. You just ride it right through.” We would have lost potentially millions of people."
2631,2020-04-05,No. It would have been unsustainable. It would have been impossible to do.
2632,2020-04-05,"And the American people have been so disciplined. It's been my honor to be their President. I've said it before, I'll say it again, I'll say it always: It's been — it's been my great honor to have been their President."
2633,2020-04-05,"And I have a big decision coming up, and I only hope to God that it's the right decision. But it'll be based on the input from a lot of very talented people, very smart people, and people that love our country."
2634,2020-04-05,Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
2635,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. A lot of things going on, and we're going to be going over to the Hill, and we're having a lot of meetings. And, from the financial — this is a medical situation, not a financial situation. The financial, though, is moving along very nicely."
2636,2020-04-05,"I want to thank you for being here and update you on the progress we've made after a week of extraordinary mobilization in our war against the virus. Governors, mayors, the businesses, charities, and citizens are all working with urgency and speed toward one common goal, which is saving American lives."
2637,2020-04-05,We're in communication with foreign countries. It's now at 148 foreign countries. Can you believe that? One hundred — you talk about a spread. You talk about a violent spread. One hundred and forty-eight countries. Not even believable.
2638,2020-04-05,"This has been a week of national action and of great national solidarity. People are getting along. We're getting along with Republicans and Democrats and independents and liberals and conservatives. And actually, it's a very nice thing to see. We're all one beautiful, big American family, and that's taking place right now."
2639,2020-04-05,"Last night, I proved a major disaster declaration for the State of New York. I worked very closely with Governor Cuomo. And is the first time in our nation's history that a President has used the Stafford Act to declare a major disaster in response to a public health crisis. Never happened before. I'm considering other areas where we may or may not be doing that. And I'm working very closely with Gavin Newsom, Governor of California, and others; we may be doing the same thing, depending on their needs, depending on what they're asking for."
2640,2020-04-05,"It's been unprecedented action in New York, and we've had a tremendous federal response all over the country. And I want to thank all the people in the federal government and obviously in the state governments and local governments. We are working hard. Everybody is working hard. And the people standing alongside of me are working very hard, that I can tell you."
2641,2020-04-05,"We've also reached agreements with Canada and Mexico on new travel rules at our northern and southern borders to halt the entry of the Chinese virus while continuing trade and commerce. And we've had very good talks, I've — with Prime Minister Trudeau, and today, this morning, with President López Obrador. And we talked about joint measures that we're taken to prevent the spread of the virus in our countries and to temporarily suspend nonessential travel. We had a great conversation this morning — the President of Mexico. And our close cooperation with Mexico and Canada will keep our people healthy, keep their people healthy, keep everybody safe."
2642,2020-04-05,"Yesterday, I had a call with 12,000 small businesses — representatives of these businesses. That's the engine of our country. People don't realize that. You know, you read all about the big ones, but the — these small businesses, when you add them up together, are really the engine — economic engine of our country. And I assured them that my administration is doing everything within its very considerable — considerable power, frankly, to support them and their employees."
2643,2020-04-05,"Nobody has ever done what we've done. Likewise, I had calls during the week with all sorts of representatives and systems, like the hospital system. We spoke to many of the hospital systems throughout the country — nurses and doctors, representatives representing hundreds of thousands of nurses and doctors; airlines and cruise ship companies."
2644,2020-04-05,"The business roundtable, which was fully attended and it's all of the top CEOs of our country and beyond, frankly — the businessmen of — really, these a world — world-styled businessmen. These are businessmen that control the biggest companies in the world. Many of them have taken hits, and many of them are just, you know, going forward. They — their businesses have been — have been great. Some have been very badly affected, some haven't been affected at all, and, frankly, some are doing very well. They continue to do very well."
2645,2020-04-05,"It's — Walmart, as an example, has been really helpful to us. Doug McMillon, the head of Walmart — really helpful to us. And I guess — I assume they're doing pretty well because people are certainly buying — buying more than even a clip at Christmas, by substantial numbers. Pretty amazing. But they're doing incredibly. They put on tremendous extra staff. You don't have empty shelves. A lot of things have happened that are very good."
2646,2020-04-05,"Restaurants, fast food executives, grocery stores, all retailers — literally, all of them — in groups."
2647,2020-04-05,"And we spoke with the G7 leaders at length, as you know. You probably know about that."
2648,2020-04-05,Spoke to many of the governors. Spoke almost all of the governors at conference calls and many of the governors individually.
2649,2020-04-05,"And, very importantly, the religious leaders. We had a great conversation yesterday — the Vice President and myself — with the religious leaders of — of our country. Many of the religious leaders. And we've had a number of them, during the course of the last two weeks, actually. But yesterday, we had a very, very significant call with the religious leaders of our country."
2650,2020-04-05,"I signed legislation providing American workers with paid sick leave and paid family medical leave at no cost to employers and free testing for those who need it. The testing is going very well and the Admiral will speak to that, along with Tony."
2651,2020-04-05,"We're working quickly to pass additional legislation that will provide massive relief to small businesses and affected industries and give direct payments to our great workers and hardworking American families. There's never been anything like we're doing on the Hill right now. They're negotiating — Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer. They're all up there — Kevin McCarthy and Nancy Pelosi. They're all negotiating and everybody is working hard and they want to get to a solution that's the right solution. I think we're getting very close."
2652,2020-04-05,"We've also announced that we've moved Tax Day from April 15 to July 15, which is a big deal, giving businesses and individuals extra time to file and pay without interest or penalty. So we've moved the date way back. And so it'll be July 15, instead of your traditional April 15. And, very importantly, you will have a lot of time, but you're not going to have interest penalties or any kind of penalties by filing at that later date."
2653,2020-04-05,"HUD announced that foreclosures and evictions are suspended for single-family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages for the next 60 days. And our great head of HUD, who's with us today, Ben Carson, is going to say a few words in a moment."
2654,2020-04-05,"The Department of Education will not enforce standardized testing — which is another big deal — requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current school year. Not fair to do that, so we are waiving that. I would imagine it's probably the first time ever that has been waived, but I think it's only fair to the students and to the parents of the students."
2655,2020-04-05,"It is also waiving interest and other things that we're discussing right now on federally held student loans and directed that borrowers be allowed to suspend their student loan payments without penalty for at least 60 days. And we'll be talking about student loans; going to help the students. They're under a great burden right now, so we will be talking about that further. But we're — we're waiving, during this 60-day period, various elements — very important elements — on student loans. Big subject."
2656,2020-04-05,"I signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act, as you all know, giving us powerful new authorities to help states, cities, and hospitals procure needed supplies. There's been a clear call to action to the private sector, and the call is made right here. It's been really pretty amazing what's happened with the private sector — they are really in sixth gear, I think — which has responded in full force, helping to produce and supply much-needed masks, swabs, sanitizers, ventilators, and everything else. There's a move on that's incredible right now."
2657,2020-04-05,"And, by way of example, Hanes — everybody knows Hanes; great company, great consumer cotton products company — is retrofitting its manufacturing capabilities in large sections of their plants to produce masks. And they're in that process right now."
2658,2020-04-05,"And, at my direction, the FDA is taking rapid steps to make these items available for medical use right now. Most excitingly to me is what the FDA has done in order to get, possibly, a very successful number — it's not just one or two — number of therapeutics: medicines that can help — help people that are already sick, help people not get sick. And, obviously, you know about the vaccine. And Tony will discuss that a little bit later, but the vaccine is moving along."
2659,2020-04-05,"But this is something that, right now — for right now, this is what we really — it's incredible. And what the FDA has done and Dr. Stephen Hahn, who is highly respected — came as a — just a highly respected man. He's been fantastic. He's only been here for a couple of months and he's — he's gotten thrown into the swim of it and he's really standing up."
2660,2020-04-05,But the FDA has really moved mountains. I said it this morning: They've moved mountains to get approvals on things that — that maybe work. We'll find out very soon. It won't take long.
2661,2020-04-05,"An example of the Pernod Ricard, which is — this is really an example where we're repurposing alcohol. They went out and repurposed their alcohol production capabilities in Arkansas, Kentucky, Texas, and West Virginia to make hand sanitizer. That's a big difference. And they've been unbelievable. They really — Pernod Ricard. Their first delivery will be on Tuesday. It's going to go to various states. They're going to start, I think, in New York and they're going to work their way around. They're making a tremendous amount of hand sanitizer — at a very high level too, by the way."
2662,2020-04-05,"We've activated the National Response Coordination Center to Level 1. That's your highest level. This is the nerve center of all of our government response to crisis and it's coordinating very closely with our nation's governors. Our nation's governors — many of you were at the call yesterday with the governors and I think you can see the relationship. And we've had numerous calls with governors, by the way, but the relationships are pretty amazing. They like — they're loving what we're doing and the coordination between the federal government and the governors, states, and even local has been pretty incredible."
2663,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Thank you, Mike."
2664,2020-04-05,"Admiral, please."
2665,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, Admiral. Dr. Fauci, please."
2666,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Tony, very much. Please."
2667,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, Pete. Appreciate it."
2668,2020-04-05,"Ben, please."
2669,2020-04-05,"Okay. Ben, thank you very much. A few questions, please."
2670,2020-04-05,I just took one.
2671,2020-04-05,I feel great.
2672,2020-04-05,I feel great.
2673,2020-04-05,I hope I look good. I feel great.
2674,2020-04-05,Those people are going to be —
2675,2020-04-05,I took one test.
2676,2020-04-05,"Well, what they do right now is keep receiving their paycheck, and hopefully their companies are going to be in a very strong position. We want to keep everything together because we think we're going to have a tremendous bounce back. Now, some people agree with that very strongly. Some of our top economists, they think we're going to have a very — once we solve the problem of — that we're working on — the medical problem."
2677,2020-04-05,"So we want them to keep their jobs, stay where you are, and we'll see what happens. Now, if they don't, we have unemployment, we have checks, we have a lot of things happening, a lot of very positive things. Nobody has ever done — now, this is working with Democrats; this is Republicans and Democrats and myself working together. Nobody has ever done a package like this. It's a great package, but ideally, we want them to be able to keep their jobs, keep the pay coming, and I think that's going to happen."
2678,2020-04-05,"Kelly, go ahead."
2679,2020-04-05,Good.
2680,2020-04-05,Right.
2681,2020-04-05,"Because we have so many companies making so many products — every product that you mentioned, plus ventilators and everything else. We have car companies — without having to use the act. If I don't have to use — specifically, we have the act to use, in case we need it. But we have so many things being made right now by so many — they've just stepped up."
2682,2020-04-05,"In fact, Mike Pence and I were discussing it before. We've never seen anything like it where they are volunteering. “We want to make masks. We want to...” Like Hanes or — I brought that up as an example. General Motors, I bring that up as another. Ford."
2683,2020-04-05,"They're going — they're going to go on the open market. We want them on the open market from a — the standpoint of pricing. Because otherwise, it's going to be — we could be very unfairly treated."
2684,2020-04-05,"We are directing states — and sometimes we'll be competing against states, which I don't want, and we'll drop out of the bidding. We want the states to go first. And, you know, what we're doing is we're helping states. That's what we want to do. Same thing with the testing. We're helping states. We're helping states get to where they want, and we've made tremendous progress in every aspect of it."
2685,2020-04-05,It's happening fast —
2686,2020-04-05,"Well, it's happening fast right now, and the governors are out there trying to get — and if they are competing with us, we immediately drop out."
2687,2020-04-05,Please.
2688,2020-04-05,My people are and I'll be staying here. I'll be in the Oval Office and various other places in the White House.
2689,2020-04-05,Right.
2690,2020-04-05,"Okay. So I've spoken with — I'm not going to say who I speak with, but I've spoken with, directly or indirectly, everybody — many, many times. We're doing very well. I think the Democrats and the Republicans are going to come up with a package that's going to be really something very special. It's going to help people."
2691,2020-04-05,"This is the first time there's ever been a case where you want people not to work. It's always — you know, you want to create incentive to work. We're creating not an incentive not to work, but the fact is we're asking people not to work because of — we have — they have to stay away from each other. If we're going to kill this horrible, hidden enemy, we have to stay away."
2692,2020-04-05,"So there's never been a thing like this in the history of the world. And other nations are doing similar things — some effectively, some not effectively. They're doing similar things."
2693,2020-04-05,"We are creating a package that's going to keep companies together, keep workers paid, so they can live and sustain. We'll see what the timing is. The biggest thing we can do is get rid of the problem. The problem is exactly what we know: the medical problem. We want to have this whole, incredible situation that it can start right away — not that all these companies break up, all the workers are out of jobs, you can't put it back together, and it would take years to put them back together."
2694,2020-04-05,"Because we had the greatest economy in the history of the world until we got hit by this problem. And we can be back very, very quickly and it's our intention to be back very, very quickly."
2695,2020-04-05,"So we're doing a package, the likes of which nobody has ever done before. I'm obviously the one that has to approve the different things and the recommendations of the different things. And — like buybacks, as an example, and stock buybacks. I didn't like it the first time and this time I'm saying, “You're not doing it. I don't want money to be used for that.” I want money to be used for workers and for opening businesses, keeping businesses open, not buybacks. And —"
2696,2020-04-05,"Well, I — I would — I am strongly recommending a buyback exclusion. You cannot buy back your stock. You can't take a billion dollars of the money and just buy back your stock and increase the value."
2697,2020-04-05,Please.
2698,2020-04-05,"Mike, go ahead."
2699,2020-04-05,When will the masks start coming in?
2700,2020-04-05,That's what you'd —
2701,2020-04-05,"Yeah, that's what I'd like to know: When will they (inaudible)?"
2702,2020-04-05,He's worse than I am. (Laughter.)
2703,2020-04-05,And we have a lot of them that have already come in. A lot have already come in.
2704,2020-04-05,"I have to tell you, the throwing away of the mask — being in private business, the throwing away of the mask right away — they're thrown away. And when you hear 55 million masks were ordered, I'm saying, “55 million? How could it possibly be such a number?” And they say, “Oh, that's just a small fraction of what we need.”"
2705,2020-04-05,"And I said, “Why aren't we sanitizing masks?” You know, you look at the masks — I've looked at all the different masks. Some don't lend themselves to doing that, I think, but many do. And I said, “Why aren't we...” — we have very good liquids for doing this, sanitizing the masks. And that's something they're — they're starting to do more and more. They're sanitizing the masks. And I don't know if anybody would like to speak to that. You might want to just —"
2706,2020-04-05,"I would have liked that much better, personally."
2707,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Go ahead, Mike."
2708,2020-04-05,Yesterday.
2709,2020-04-05,You mean the ones that are saying good things or bad things?
2710,2020-04-05,"Well, I'll tell you the way I look at it. So, many administrations preceded me. For the most part, they did very little, in terms of what you're talking about. This is unprecedented. You can speak to Tony; you could speak to anybody. This is unprecedented or just about unprecedented."
2711,2020-04-05,"As time goes by, we're seeing it's really at a level that nobody would've believed. Nobody would've thought possible that this could happen. And we are making much of this stuff now. And much of it's being delivered now."
2712,2020-04-05,"We've also gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people that can't believe how fast it's coming. I mean, when I hear they have an order of 55 million masks — and that's just one order; that's one order out of many — and that there are many millions of masks beyond that that are ready — and I keep saying, “How is it possible to use so much?” But that's the way it is. And part of that is because they'll use a mask for a short period of time and they throw it."
2713,2020-04-05,"The fact is that we are doing a tremendous amount. We started with very few masks. We had some, but nothing for an event like this. And now we're making tens of millions of masks and other things. And I think it's unprecedented what we've done and what we're doing. And many doctors — and I've read many, many doctors, they can't believe the great job that we've done."
2714,2020-04-05,Yes.
2715,2020-04-05,"Kelly, did you have one?"
2716,2020-04-05,"Well, if you remember —"
2717,2020-04-05,"— I was the one that closed the country down. I was the one that closed the — you don't write that or you don't say it too much, certainly on CNN. But I just read an article yesterday —"
2718,2020-04-05,"I just read an article yesterday that, by closing the country down so early — we were very early — we saved tens of thousands — and much more than that — lives. So you know, you might want to report that, too."
2719,2020-04-05,"Tony, would you like to say something about that?"
2720,2020-04-05,Sooner.
2721,2020-04-05,Sooner.
2722,2020-04-05,It's sooner than weeks.
2723,2020-04-05,"And, again, what we're doing is we're trying to help the states get things faster. And that's what we're doing: We're implementing."
2724,2020-04-05,"And the magnitude of this — it's a tragedy. It's an absolute tragedy. But the magnitude is something that, no matter who you were, no matter where you come from, nobody ever thought a thing like this could happen."
2725,2020-04-05,"You read about 1917 and you read about certain things, but you think, in a modern age, a thing like that could never happen. Well, it comes back. It is genius. It comes back. And it's too bad. But I think the people working on this have been incredible. The job they've done has really been incredible."
2726,2020-04-05,"But there's tremendous amounts of — not only masks — of ventilators and respirators and everything you can think of. It's all being — much of it and almost, I could say, all of it is being manufactured right now."
2727,2020-04-05,"Steve, please."
2728,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know that — “resolved.” I can say that it's going to be distributed. I know New York is getting, I think, 10,000 units, and numerous other people. It's really — it could be the malaria drug plus the Z-Pak."
2729,2020-04-05,"But — and we're going to find out. We're going to find out. I feel — look, I feel, as the expression goes, “What do we have to lose?” Because, you know, I feel very — I feel very good about it. Tony would feel, you know, like — he'd like samples done in a certain way. And I understand that too. Many doctors agree with that. We don't have much time. You know, we have a lot of very sick people right now in hospitals all over the place."
2730,2020-04-05,"And speaking with the Governor of New York — Cuomo — I said, “How does it look?” He's got a lot of sick people. So we're going to be delivering a lot of samples to New York and other places, and we're going to find out very shortly whether or not it's going to work."
2731,2020-04-05,"I feel very confident. I mean, I've seen things that surprise me, frankly. There are — as Tony said, there are other things we're looking at too. Vaccine, of course, is incredible, but this is more immediate."
2732,2020-04-05,"Right now, this, to me, would be the greatest thing that could happen. This would be a gift from Heaven. This would be a gift from God if it works. So we're going to pray to God that it does work. It'd be a fantastic thing."
2733,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. In the back."
2734,2020-04-05,My businesses?
2735,2020-04-05,Sure.
2736,2020-04-05,"Well, I wouldn't say you're thriving when you decide to close down your hotels and your businesses. No, I would say — but, you know, I'm very under-levered and everything, so that's good. But is it hurting my — yeah. It's hurting me and it's hurting Hilton and it's hurting all of the great hotel chains all over the world."
2737,2020-04-05,"It's hurting everybody. I mean, there are very few businesses that are doing well. Now, there are some that are. Like, as an example, the Walmarts of the world, because everybody's lined up to get things and stock up their house, and this and that."
2738,2020-04-05,"But sure, it hurts my business. But —"
2739,2020-04-05,"No, I didn't speak to anybody. I speak to my sons, but — I talk about the coronavirus, but not as it pertains to my business. They basically follow the rules; when they say close them down, in New York, we close them down or wherever they may be. I have them — I actually have them all over the world. And when they say —"
2740,2020-04-05,"And when they say, “Close them down,” we close them down."
2741,2020-04-05,"What, Kelly?"
2742,2020-04-05,"Well, I have nothing planned at Mar-a-Lago. But, right now, I think Mar-a-Lago, I guess — I haven't even asked, but I imagine that's closed down, just like a lot of other businesses in Florida."
2743,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. Go ahead, please."
2744,2020-04-05,"I don't know. I mean, I just don't know what the government assistance would be for what I have. I have hotels. Everybody knew I had hotels when I got elected. They knew I was a successful person when I got elected. So it's one of those things."
2745,2020-04-05,"I guess I get paid $450,000 a year; I give it up. I put it back into the nation. I usually — I have to — by the way, you have to designate where you want it, so I oftentimes give it to opioid research and things."
2746,2020-04-05,"But, as far as the hotels and everything, I mean, I have to do what everyone else is doing. I would probably decide to close things up. I think it's a good thing nation- — you don't want people getting together. And hotels and clubs and everything, you get together. We want to beat this deal."
2747,2020-04-05,"So I have many of them — hotels, clubs, things like that — where people get together. I would think it would be a good practice to close them up."
2748,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead, please."
2749,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2750,2020-04-05,"Well, I do it. I do it. I have temperature tests and I don't — I didn't ask everybody here, but I wouldn't be surprised if they had temperature tests."
2751,2020-04-05,"I took his temperature twice, actually."
2752,2020-04-05,"And I say — I've seen things — when Tony mentions thermometers, they aim something at your forehead, they stay this far away, boom, and they tell you what your temperature is. I said, “I've never seen that before.” I've learned a lot. I've learned a lot. It's incredible."
2753,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, in the back — the back corner. Back corner."
2754,2020-04-05,"Well, I love whoever you're with. That's — because I think that's such a nice — it's such a nice question."
2755,2020-04-05,"No, I think the Washington Post covers us very inaccurately, covers me very inaccurately. I saw the story. I think it's a disgrace. But it's the Washington Post and I guess we have to live with it. It's a very —"
2756,2020-04-05,"It's a very inaccurate — quiet, quiet. It's a very inaccurate story."
2757,2020-04-05,"From many people, I get a lot of credit for having closed our country very early to a very heavily infected country: China. Unfortunately, China. I wish China would have told us more about what was going on in China, long prior to us reading about it, even though the news isn't exactly disseminated."
2758,2020-04-05,"As you know, China kicked the Washington Post out of China and they kicked the New York Times out of China and I guess the Wall Street Journal. That's okay. I mean, that's what they do and I think it's a terrible thing they did."
2759,2020-04-05,"But I also think it's terrible when people write inaccurately about you. And they write inaccurately about me every single day, every single hour. And, by the way, your group really — I really think — and I just say “fair,” not “good” or “bad” — I think you write very fairly and do very fair reports about the great job that all of us are doing that this group behind me is doing."
2760,2020-04-05,"It's so insulting when they write phony stories that they know are fake news. Because they're not insulting me; they're insulting everybody — these incredible people that have worked so hard, so long, that are thinking about nothing other than this invisible enemy. They have done such an incredible job and they will continue, and we're going to win, and there'll be a lot of celebration when we win"
2761,2020-04-05,"And we're going to win with as few lives lost as possible. That's the game: Win with as few lives lost as possible. It's a tough enemy. It's a tough killer. Far bigger, far more vicious than ever before."
2762,2020-04-05,"But I appreciate you saying it because the fact that we closed so early to China — and most people — hey, look, I was called “xenophobic” by Sleepy Joe Biden. I was called a “racist” by Democrats. A racist. I was a racist because I decided that I didn't want to have people that could hurt our country come in. And I was pretty much in a very small group of people — I will tell you, it was a tiny little group — most people, even that worked in the White House, disagreed with me very strongly."
2763,2020-04-05,"Saving those many weeks was a tremendous — a tremendous thing. And when they keep talking about acting early, that was the ultimate act. That was the biggest act, because we didn't — and then I also called Europe early. Very early. And I took a lot of heat for that too, but that was a good thing. Now they're doing similar things that we're doing."
2764,2020-04-05,"So, I didn't act late; I acted early. I acted far before anybody thought I should be. I took tremendous criticism from the various papers, from many of the papers."
2765,2020-04-05,"So I — I very much appreciate the question. It might have been — it might have been more of a statement than a question. But whatever it may have been, I appreciate it very much."
2766,2020-04-05,Yes.
2767,2020-04-05,"No, no. They can do what they want to do. If California can get a mask sooner than we can get it for them, through all of the things we're able to do — but we're going to end up with a big oversupply at some point. You know, at some point, this is going away. And we're going to end up with a big oversupply. And you know what? In this case, that's going to be okay."
2768,2020-04-05,"But if California — if Gavin can go out and order gowns faster, or masks — good masks — faster, or other things faster, that's good. We do have a lot of — I mean, the coordination with the ships that we're sending in, as you know — the medical ships that we're sending in and even cruise liners — we're going to be sending in, probably, cruise liners into some areas — in particular, California, and in particular, New York."
2769,2020-04-05,"But if somebody can do something faster, if they can order that mask faster than us, I want them to be able to do it."
2770,2020-04-05,"We coordinate very much with them, yes."
2771,2020-04-05,"Well, it doesn't have to be at this moment, because we have places in the country where, you know — states where they have two people or three people and those people are in quarantine. And you can't put on them what you're putting in New York, where you do have a tremendous problem."
2772,2020-04-05,"I mean, we have large portions of the country — Middle America — where, you know, they have a few people. So, it may be a time — I hope that never happens, where we need to take very drastic action. But, right now, that's not in the same ballpark."
2773,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Go ahead, please."
2774,2020-04-05,Yes.
2775,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2776,2020-04-05,"I think they are. And some people are not. But I think they are. I think it's going to have a very profound effect. I mean, we'll know a little bit more on day 14 and 15. We'll see."
2777,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to see. We have to see what the result is. We want to flatten that out and we're going to see what the result is."
2778,2020-04-05,"And, I just want to say: I'm going to negotiate a very large transaction and I've been negotiating it for two days. So I'm going to take one or two more questions and then I'm going to leave it to Vice President Pence."
2779,2020-04-05,On the Hill. With the Hill.
2780,2020-04-05,The various — the various elements of the package.
2781,2020-04-05,"Steve, go ahead."
2782,2020-04-05,"No, I haven't. I — look, we understand the difficulty of that. And he's a very good friend of mine. You talk a — you take a look at Shinzo Abe. He's a great gentleman. He loves his country. We have an incredible relationship. We just finished a trade deal with them — a $40 billion trade deal with Japan."
2783,2020-04-05,"And Prime Minister Abe has a big decision to make. You know, they have built one of the most beautiful venues I've ever seen. They were all ready to go. It's not late. It's not over budget. It's not — it was just done flawlessly, and it's beautiful. And they're sitting back and saying, you know — I have — I told him, I said, “That's your decision.” And it is his decision and I know he's going to make it soon, I don't know what it's going to be, and I didn't think I should be influencing it at all."
2784,2020-04-05,"I mean, the job that Japan has done on that venue is incredible. So, I mean, there are options, obviously, including delay and maybe delay for next year, but that's totally up to them. We'll see what they do."
2785,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2786,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2787,2020-04-05,Because it's true.
2788,2020-04-05,Because it's true. China has worked very hard. China has lost thousands and thousands of people.
2789,2020-04-05,"No, they weren't transparent. They were transparent at that time, but when we saw what happened, they could have been transparent much earlier than they were."
2790,2020-04-05,"Right. But China — just so you understand, China is not a beneficiary here. China has thousands and thousands of people. China has gone through hell over this. They've gone through hell. And I've had conversations with President Xi. I just wish they could have told us earlier. They knew they had a problem earlier. I wish they could have said that."
2791,2020-04-05,Thank you.
2792,2020-04-05,"Well, I'm going to leave that up to Dr. Fauci and everybody else. And I think the answer is: We want to share them. I would imagine we want to share the numbers as — Admiral, do you want to discuss that?"
2793,2020-04-05,Not “billion.” No. Not billion.
2794,2020-04-05,"Yes. (Laughs.) I said, “Wait a minute.”"
2795,2020-04-05,"Well, there's never been numbers like this. You know, a ventilator is a machine. It's a very complex machine. And to think that we have to order hundreds of thousands — nobody has ever heard of a thing like this."
2796,2020-04-05,"You know, when we had, in the stockpile — we had thousands in a stockpile. Thousands, ready to go. That's a lot. All of a sudden, you need hundreds of thousands. And you're not talking about — you know, the mask is whether it's plastic or whether it's material; that's one thing. But you're talking about a very sophisticated, heavily computerized machine — and delicate. And you need hundreds of thousands of them. Nobody has ever heard of a thing like that."
2797,2020-04-05,"With that being said, General Motors, Ford, so many companies — I had three calls yesterday directly. Without having to institute — like, “You will do this” — these companies are making them right now. But to think of these numbers, it's pretty — it's pretty mindboggling."
2798,2020-04-05,"Well — Mike, go ahead, please."
2799,2020-04-05,You understand it. You understand it.
2800,2020-04-05,"You're an intelligent woman, Kelly. You understand exactly what he's saying. And what he's is rather incredible because we — we inherited an obsolete, broken system. And when you hear the number of tests that we'll be providing –and are now — it's incredible. And I've heard a lot of governors say the same thing."
2801,2020-04-05,"We took over an obsolete, broken testing system that wouldn't have worked for even a small problem, let alone one of the biggest pandemics in history. And what these gentlemen have done is incredible."
2802,2020-04-05,"I am going now to negotiate a great deal for our workers and our citizens. I'll be back tomorrow. We're probably doing this tomorrow. And, if I might, I'd like to ask Vice President Pence to take over. And thank you all very much."
2803,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. This is a holy week, when religious believers across the nation will observe Passover, Good Friday, and Easter. Millions of Jewish families begin Passover at sundown tonight, a sacred, unbroken tradition that traces back to the ancient land of Egypt. And on Sunday, we celebrate our beautiful, wonderful Easter, which we all look forward to. And we're going to have many Easters together in churches in the future."
2804,2020-04-05,"We're getting closer. You see the numbers. We're getting much closer to getting our country back to the way it was. We have now an extra two countries that have been attacked: 184. They're being attacked as we speak, but we'll all win. At some point, we're going to all win. We're going to do it sooner than people think."
2805,2020-04-05,"Earlier today, I spoke with 10,000 of America's faith leaders to thank them for raising the spirits of our people during these very difficult days. While we may be physically apart, we can use this time to pray, to reflect, and to focus on our personal relationship with God."
2806,2020-04-05,"I also spoke with more than 3,000 mayors, county commissioners, and state and tribal leaders to provide an update on our administration's ongoing drive to beat the virus, to crush the virus. And that's happening. And it's happening, I think if you look, a little bit more quickly than people thought. Maybe a lot more quickly, I hope. And it's something that all over the world we're watching, but people are watching us and seeing what we're doing, and they're very impressed. We're dealing with many countries right now. Many, many countries. And we're giving them whatever information we're able to glean."
2807,2020-04-05,"I just spoke with the representatives of the UK, and I think that their great prime minister is doing much better today, or at least better. But certainly he's had a tough bout, and he's still going through a tough time, but he seems to be doing better. And that's good."
2808,2020-04-05,"And we — we send our regards to Boris and his family and his friends, all of the people that really love him. He's — he's become a very popular — before this happened, became a very popular prime minister. He's doing an excellent job. He loves their country; he loves our country. So we appreciate everything he's done, and hopefully he's going to be okay."
2809,2020-04-05,"Speaking of great people, and people that have done a fantastic job, I have Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with us. And I'd like to ask Mike to say a few words. And then I think what we'll do, in order to get him back to the State Department, we'll take some questions and we'll then go on with the rest of what I'm going to say. And then we'll take some questions after that, and then Vice President Pence will take over."
2810,2020-04-05,"So, Mike Pompeo, please."
2811,2020-04-05,Good.
2812,2020-04-05,"Very good. Thanks, Mike. Maybe you stick for a little while —"
2813,2020-04-05,— and we'll see if anybody has any questions for Secretary of State.
2814,2020-04-05,Anybody? Please.
2815,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. In the middle, and then him behind."
2816,2020-04-05,You can say we helped.
2817,2020-04-05,"Well, you can just say we helped."
2818,2020-04-05,Jeff.
2819,2020-04-05,"Okay? Go ahead, please."
2820,2020-04-05,Haven't made a determination.
2821,2020-04-05,Okay?
2822,2020-04-05,Let's save it. Can we save it?
2823,2020-04-05,(Inaudible) busy man. He's a busy man.
2824,2020-04-05,"Okay? Thank you, Mike."
2825,2020-04-05,"Appreciate it. Thanks. Okay, thank you very much."
2826,2020-04-05,"In just a few days, we've delivered nearly 11 million N95 masks to hotspots around the country, as you know, including 6.6 million to New York and New Jersey, 1.8 million to Chicago, 1.7 million to Detroit, and 837,000 to New Orleans."
2827,2020-04-05,"I spoke with the governor of Louisiana a little while ago, and they're doing, really, pretty well. Much better than they thought. They'll be using fewer beds. As you know, we built a hospital. We're about set to complete another hospital, and there's even a possibility they won't — they won't need it. That's what we discussed."
2828,2020-04-05,"To date, we've shipped out more than 8,000 ventilators, and we have 10,000 — almost 10,000 sitting. They are ready to go, should we need them. And an additional 2,200 newly manufactured ventilators come online on Monday. We're going to be sending them to various locations, just in case they need them."
2829,2020-04-05,"My administration is working with Philips to double their production of ventilators by May, and ultimately quadruple production by later this year. High-quality ventilators. We're eliminating bureaucratic barriers to pave the way for Philips's major investments in American manufacturing sites and sales."
2830,2020-04-05,"This will help to ensure that our country can permanently produce enough ventilators in the future that we can do them by ourselves. We're going to have a big stockpile when we're finished. And we expect to be sending quite a few to other countries to help them after we're finished. And even now, we're — a couple of countries are really, really in dire need. And it looks like our projections were right on ventilators, and some states that were thinking they would need thousands of more than they thought will — are now already taken care of, which we're very happy about."
2831,2020-04-05,"In addition, beginning in May, we'll be receiving almost 300 million new face masks. We're going to have masks of about 300 million; they'll be starting to be delivered in May and during the month of June. So we're ordering a big stockpile, and we're thinking about doing an extra 200 million should we need them, or for the — or for the stockpile. So we'll be in a position to have something incredible. It'll be a total of 500 million masks."
2832,2020-04-05,"And today, 750,000 new protective gowns landed in Dallas, Texas, as a result of a partnership led by the federal government, DuPont, and FedEx. And that's been a great partnership. That's worked very well. So we have 600 and — and we have 750,000 new protective gowns. And these are at a high level — very high quality."
2833,2020-04-05,"As American industry steps up to help, so are America's doctors and scientists. Ten drugs are now in clinical trials. And my administration is taking unprecedented actions to make new therapies and treatments available without delay. The doctors, the lab technicians, the companies — I spoke to them yesterday; I spoke again today. They are coming up with things that are, I think, I hope — in the very near future — are going to be very, very special, very important."
2834,2020-04-05,Our National Stockpile is now equipped with nearly 30 million hydroxychloroquine pills. So we're up to about 30 million. We're distributing by the millions.
2835,2020-04-05,"You read about State Representative Karen Whitsett, who I very much appreciate her going public. But she was, I think, very, very much helped by this pill. She saw what I was saying on television. She thought she was in very bad shape. I don't want to go further than that, but you see her story; you know her story. She's a highly respected state rep from Michigan. And she did a — she did a — I think she did a great service, what she — what she's done. She's in terrific shape. She looks fantastic. And she was very generous with her statements."
2836,2020-04-05,"In addition, the azithromycin and zinc — they say zinc — you should add zinc. Now, it's all — has to be recommended by doctors, physicians. But they say zinc. I want to throw that out there because that's where they seem to be having the best result. So you add the zinc and the azithromycin."
2837,2020-04-05,And it's been — we've had a lot of good stories. A lot of good stories. And we have almost 30 million doses. So we've got a lot. I want to thank Prime Minister Modi of India for allowing us to have what we requested from before the problem arose. And he was — he was terrific. We'll remember it.
2838,2020-04-05,"Later today, the CDC will release further guidance to help ensure critical infrastructure workers can perform their job safely after potential exposure to the virus. And so they're working on that."
2839,2020-04-05,"The question was asked a little while ago about the World Health Organization. And, as you know, they made a statement on June — on January 14th, I guess it was, that there was no human-to-human transmission. Well, there was. They probably made that statement in the second or third week of December, in addition, but they made it very powerfully on January 14th. And they criticized me very strongly when I said that we're going to shut down flights coming in from China, and especially from certain parts of China, but from China generally. We were criticized very badly."
2840,2020-04-05,"So, last year, and for many years, hundreds of millions of dollars has been paid to the World Health Organization. Hundreds of millions of dollars a year. And last year, it was $452 million, and China paid $42 million. Before that, it was $500 million, and China paid less than $40 million. And before that, it was similar numbers — in the 400s, 300s, and sometimes even in the 500s of millions of dollars. And China would do proportionately just a small fraction of that number."
2841,2020-04-05,"And I think they have to get their priorities right, and their priorities are that everybody has to be treated properly — every country. And it doesn't seem that way, does it? It doesn't seem that way."
2842,2020-04-05,"So we're going to do — study, investigation, and we're going to make a determination as to what we're doing. In the meantime, we're holding back. We're going to — we want to see. It's very unfair."
2843,2020-04-05,"So the United States — $452 million compared to $42 million. That's to the World Health Organization. That's not good. That's not good. Not fair. Not fair at all. And other countries, as you know, also gave very substantially less than the United States."
2844,2020-04-05,"And the World — WHO — World Health got it wrong. I mean, they got it very wrong. In many ways, they were wrong. They also minimized the threat very strongly and — not good."
2845,2020-04-05,"I want to take this opportunity to express the thanks of an extremely grateful nation to the Americans who go to work every day, especially in these critical industries, in the midst of the pandemic to care for and protect and feed American people, including medical personnel, law enforcement, first responders, food suppliers, sanitation workers."
2846,2020-04-05,"And somebody mentioned today, “Would you please specifically call out cashiers and clerks at grocery stores who are in danger during the — during the pandemic, during the epidemic?” They're in danger. They're really in great danger. And they've been incredible and I want to call them out — to cashiers and clerks. We grew up with cashiers and clerks and grocery stores and they've been great and they've really been true American heroes, so I want to call them out because they're working hard and they're working in conditions that aren't ideal. But soon they'll be ideal again."
2847,2020-04-05,"As we mourn the terrible loss of life for this — and from this — this grave pandemic, we're seeing signs that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread is working. The number of new cases is stabilizing. The number of beds necessary in so many locations — I was watching, this morning, New York. I was watching Louisiana. You see what's going on. The numbers are changing and they're changing rapidly. And soon we'll be over that curve. We'll be over the top and we'll be headed in the right direction. I feel strongly about that."
2848,2020-04-05,"Some terrible days ahead, but we're going to have some — some wonderful days ahead. And we're going to get this behind us, this terrible thing behind us. Some people will never be able to forget if they had a loved one or if they had a great friend or a friend — but we're going to get it behind us."
2849,2020-04-05,"This is a tribute to the discipline and the devotion of the American people, what we've accomplished. If every American continues to strictly adhere to social distancing guidelines, we can defeat the invisible enemy and save countless lives and we can do it much more quickly."
2850,2020-04-05,"We're hopefully heading toward a final stretch — the light at the end of the tunnel, as I was saying. As we continue to wage all-out medical war to defeat the virus, we're also fighting an economic war to ensure we can quickly turn to full financial strength. We have to get our country back. We have to get going. Everybody wants to get going."
2851,2020-04-05,"Yesterday, I asked Congress to provide an additional $250 billion to expand the incredibly successful Paycheck Protection Program — you've seen what's gone on there; it's incredible, actually — which is allowing our small businesses to keep employees on the payroll and get ready for the opening. Like a second opening."
2852,2020-04-05,"To protect millions of American jobs, I'm asking Congress to pass additional funding for this program this week, as soon as possible. And I think we have a pretty good understanding with the Democrats. Hopefully, it's going to be bipartisan. We do not have time for the partisan games and we don't want that — the obstruction or totally unrelated agendas. We want to do this for the small businesses and the workers. And we can do a phase four and phase four will be later."
2853,2020-04-05,"This will be an expansion of what we've already done because it's so successful. The $350 billion will be expanded by hopefully 250 and, if you look at the kind of loans, thousands — tens of thousands of loans to small businesses. It's a — it's a great thing to see. It's turned out to be more successful and more productive than anybody would have thought. But Democrats or Republicans are coming together to get that job done. That's a very important job."
2854,2020-04-05,"In recent days and days ahead, we'll restore America's health and economic might, but also dimensions of our national strength will be brought together, I think, stronger than — I think we have a chance to be stronger than ever before. We've learned a lot and we have tremendous stimulus now. Tremendous stimulus. And we're going for more. Hopefully, we'll be doing an infrastructure bill so we can rebuild our roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and all of the things that we should be doing for our country. We're going to rebuild our country, not other countries where they don't even appreciate it."
2855,2020-04-05,"As our citizens persevere through this present challenge, we're renewing American unity and we're replenishing American will and we are witnessing new American valor each and every day. We see it every day. The daring and determination of our people in this crisis reminds us that no matter how hard it gets, no matter what obstacles we must overcome, Americans will keep on fighting to victory and we will secure the glorious future that our citizens so richly deserve, especially after going through this nightmare, this evil beast."
2856,2020-04-05,"So we're getting very close and hopefully it will — hopefully, it's on the other side and it will end soon. And I think it will. And I just think that the people of this country are fantastic."
2857,2020-04-05,So we'll take a few questions and then Vice President will take over.
2858,2020-04-05,Please go ahead. Please.
2859,2020-04-05,"Well, I learned when I started — when I learned about the gravity of it was sometime just prior to closing the country to China. And when we closed up the flights coming in from China and various other elements — and then, as you know, we closed up to Europe."
2860,2020-04-05,"So, I don't know exactly, but I'd like to see the information."
2861,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Please."
2862,2020-04-05,"Yeah. So do I, more than anybody."
2863,2020-04-05,"Well, I think we can say that we have to be on that down side of that slope and heading to a very strong direction that this thing is gone. We could do it in phases. We can go to some areas, which you know. Some areas are much less affected than others."
2864,2020-04-05,"But it would be nice to be able to open with a big bang and open up our country — or certainly most of our country. And I think we're going to do that soon. If you look at what's happening, I would say we're ahead of schedule."
2865,2020-04-05,"Now, you hate to say it too loudly because, all of the sudden, things don't happen. But I think we will be sooner rather than later. But we'll be sitting down with the professionals. We'll be sitting down with many different people and making a determination. And those meetings will start taking place fairly soon."
2866,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I would — I rely very heavily on them. Yeah."
2867,2020-04-05,Yeah. We're putting in — yeah. We're putting in very heavy testing systems. We have the best testing systems.
2868,2020-04-05,"And again, don't forget when we look at cases, I'm looking at some — I'm not going to insult anybody, I'm not going to insult any country — but I'm looking at countries that are showing less cases than us; that's testing. We're testing more than anybody. And you — you saw exponentially, more than anybody, by far. And our testing has become — I think it'll end up being a big strength. In fact, the other countries — other countries that the media talked about are now calling us for what are we doing and how are we doing it so quickly and where are we getting these tests because our tests are really good now. They've been proven to be very accurate."
2869,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
2870,2020-04-05,Yeah. Sure.
2871,2020-04-05,"It's ridiculous. I agree. It's ridiculous. I think it's the highest-paid government — long before I got here — you said Tennessee Valley Authority, right? Has to be the highest-paid man in any government; makes approximately $8 or $9 million. I don't know the gentleman but he's got a heck of a job. He gets paid a lot of money. He's been there for a long while, hasn't he?"
2872,2020-04-05,"Well, that's a separate — yeah, that's separate. But I'm talking about the — the — we just have some new people going on the board, I know."
2873,2020-04-05,"But as you know, that's a quasi-public agency. And whoever the head of the agency is, that person makes a lot of money —"
2874,2020-04-05,"— which is an amazing thing, right? And when we want them to do something, they're not there for us. That's not good. That's not good. They've been there for a long time. That's been a story for a long time."
2875,2020-04-05,Yeah. Reducing it by a lot.
2876,2020-04-05,"That would be the greatest job in the history of government, almost. Certainly if you're into money. Tennessee Valley Authority. That's right."
2877,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
2878,2020-04-05,I've been waiting for somebody to ask me about that. It's been — it's been bothering me for a long time too.
2879,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
2880,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2881,2020-04-05,Which son? It must be Don.
2882,2020-04-05,I had a feeling it was Don. Is that what he said? I don't know. I know nothing about it. He has 22 years for what? What did he do?
2883,2020-04-05,You think he didn't do it? Are you on his side?
2884,2020-04-05,Are you recommending a pardon?
2885,2020-04-05,"As a reporter, you're not allowed to do that. You'd be criticized by these — would you recommend a pardon?"
2886,2020-04-05,I don't think you would. I don't think you would.
2887,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Do you have a question?
2888,2020-04-05,I'll take a look. Is that Joe Exotic?
2889,2020-04-05,That's Joe Exotic? (Laughs.)
2890,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
2891,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2892,2020-04-05,"My — yeah. My impression, Jim, is those were the numbers that were set, and they were set as an expectation from quite a while ago. I think we're just doing much better than those numbers."
2893,2020-04-05,"If either of you would like to talk about that, it's a fair question."
2894,2020-04-05,Do you want to come up? Deborah?
2895,2020-04-05,Yeah. I'm going to do that. I'm going to ask Bob to come up just for a second. Director —
2896,2020-04-05,"I think that's it: We have a — we've done, they have done, everybody has done — everybody, a great job. So those were original projections. And we don't want to say anything about beating it yet, but I think we will have a very good chance to beat them very substantially."
2897,2020-04-05,"Bob, please?"
2898,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2899,2020-04-05,"I don't remember that. I've now seen the memo. I saw it. It was — Peter sends a lot of memos. I didn't see the memo. As you know, World Health was saying that was not correct because, at the time, they called it wrong."
2900,2020-04-05,"But I didn't see the memo. But I acted as quickly as — people were shocked that I acted so quickly. And everybody thought I was wrong because I did act so quickly as you know, with respect to closing the borders — with respect not only to China, but with Europe I closed the borders. And I think that was very important."
2901,2020-04-05,"But, no, I didn't see the memo at the time. But I have seen it since."
2902,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
2903,2020-04-05,"Wait a minute, Jim. Let me — let me do a couple of others. We'll go back."
2904,2020-04-05,I agree with that.
2905,2020-04-05,"Well, I think when you say more body bags, I think we would have done — and he would have been much better serving the people that he's supposed to serve if they gave a correct analysis. I mean, everything was, I said, China-centric: “Everything was going to be fine. No human to human. Keep the borders open.” He wanted me to keep the borders open. I closed the borders despite him, and that was a hard decision to make at the time."
2906,2020-04-05,"We were all together, and we made a decision against the World Health Organization. So when he says “politicizing,” he's politicizing. That shouldn't be."
2907,2020-04-05,"But, look, we spent $450 billion, $452 billion. Almost $500 billion last year. Hundreds of billions in previous years. And they got to do better than that. They got to do better. When you talk about politics, I can't believe — he's talking about politics when look at the relationship they have to China."
2908,2020-04-05,"So China spends $42 million, we spend $450 million, and everything seems to be China's way. That's not right. It's not fair to us, and honestly, it's not fair to the world."
2909,2020-04-05,Okay. Question in the back. Yeah.
2910,2020-04-05,Yeah. It's not —
2911,2020-04-05,"I have never heard about it. Doesn't sound like a bad idea, actually. But I have not heard about that."
2912,2020-04-05,"I don't know if I'd be okay. I have to see it. But it sounds very scientific, and it sounds like it could be good, based on tracking. But it also has to do with rights and lots of different constitutional questions. I have not heard that at all."
2913,2020-04-05,"Yeah — the FISA abuse, of which I was the one abused. And a couple of other people, in all fairness."
2914,2020-04-05,"No, I don't know anything about it. I haven't heard it. I mean, I'll speak to him. I don't — I don't think so. They would have told me. I would have known about it."
2915,2020-04-05,Please.
2916,2020-04-05,In Nevada?
2917,2020-04-05,You mean because of the number of employees?
2918,2020-04-05,Q Because of the number of employees —
2919,2020-04-05,And yet they're small businesses.
2920,2020-04-05,"Well, I can look at that. I could look. It's a great state, and I will take a look at that strongly. Are you talking only the smaller casinos?"
2921,2020-04-05,Yeah. I'll take a look at that. Fine. I don't mind that.
2922,2020-04-05,"Please. Yeah. We'll take a look. Yeah. We haven't heard. Nobody has told me about it, but I'll look at it."
2923,2020-04-05,They — they — it's a great state. They do a great job. So I'm going to look at it very strongly. I understand what they mean.
2924,2020-04-05,Please.
2925,2020-04-05,"Well, when you say they don't listen, I think they're going to listen. They want to go back. Everybody wants. They're going stir crazy. They have been in those houses and those apartments and their buildings. I mean, they've really been — they have done a great job."
2926,2020-04-05,"Again, when you look — the question was just asked about — you know, about how we're doing compared to projections. Those were just original projections, the big projection being 2.2 million people would die if we did nothing. That was another decision we made: Close it up. That was a big decision that we made."
2927,2020-04-05,"Two very smart people walked into my office, and they said, “Listen, these are your alternatives.” And that was a projection of, I guess, 1.5- to 2.2 million people would die if we didn't close it up. That's a lot of people. So, if we do a number that's tremendously smaller than that — now, if we did close it up, the numbers got to 100- to 220 million people."
2928,2020-04-05,"So, if we can stay substantially under the 100, which was the original projection, I think we all did a very good job, even though it's a lot of people."
2929,2020-04-05,Say it?
2930,2020-04-05,"Well, right now, we're — I mean, we're doing well in terms of the numbers. I can't tell you in terms of the date. You know, we don't want to — we don't want to go down, and then we can start going up, if we're not careful. So, we have to be careful."
2931,2020-04-05,"As far as distancing — social distancing and other things — certainly for a while. You know, at some point, that's going away. We'll be able to sit next to each other and every — like we have all our lives. This is a very unique thing. This has not happened, anything like this, of this magnitude, since 1917, 1918, the great pandemic. That was — that was something."
2932,2020-04-05,"But — yeah, no, people want to sit next to each other at restaurants. They want to sit next to each other like normal at a football game, baseball game, basketball game, hockey game. No, we want to go back to life."
2933,2020-04-05,"Now, the first period of time, maybe we'll go a little bit slower and maybe we'll be talking about distancing. But at some point, we expect to be back like it was before. And hopefully it'll never happen. Hopefully it will — if it does happen it's going to be in a hundred years from now. The last one, 1917 — that's something. That's a long time ago. And that was — that was a horrible thing."
2934,2020-04-05,"Jim, go ahead."
2935,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2936,2020-04-05,"Yeah, sure. Well, what happened —"
2937,2020-04-05,"Well, what happened — yeah. True."
2938,2020-04-05,True and fair.
2939,2020-04-05,"The — I think there's a lot of evidence, but we'll provide you with some, okay? And there's evidence that's being compiled just like it's being compiled in the state of California, where they settled with Judicial Watch, saying that a million people should not have been voting in — you saw that."
2940,2020-04-05,"Wait, excuse me. I'm just telling you. I'm telling you, in California, in the great state of California, they settled, and we could've gone a lot further. Judicial Watch settled where they agreed that a million people should not have voted, where they were 115 years old and lots of things, and people were voting in their place."
2941,2020-04-05,"What I see and — you know, every one of those states that you mentioned is a state that happens to be won by the Democrats. And if you have a position like me, where it's registered, you're here, and we're voting someplace where I'm not — I haven't left the White House in, I guess, months, other than to, you know, ask a ship to — you know, wave it goodbye to New York — which, by the way, is now going — as you know, being used for the purpose that we're talking about, which a lot of people wanted."
2942,2020-04-05,Wait a minute.
2943,2020-04-05,Well it's — it hasn't.
2944,2020-04-05,It certainly hasn't.
2945,2020-04-05,"But if you're a senior citizen and if you're somebody that needs it, I'm all for it. But they have to be very careful, because you know the things with bundling and all of the things that are happening with votes by mail where thousands of votes are gathered. And I'm not going to say which party does it, but thousands of votes are gathered and they come in and they're dumped in a location, and then, all of a sudden, you lose elections if you think you're going to win."
2946,2020-04-05,"I won't to stand for it. Well, we're going to find out about the proof, because you're going to see what's going on. And I'm not going to stand for it. Our voting system — first of all, we should have voter ID. When you vote, you should have voter ID. And if you send something in, you should be sure — as a state and as a country, you should be sure that that vote is meaningful and it's not just made fraudulently, because there's a lot of fraudulent voting going on in this country. This country should have voter ID."
2947,2020-04-05,"Okay, let's do another one. Go, please."
2948,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2949,2020-04-05,"Well, I think it's very systematic. Yeah, we're distributing the hydroxy all through the country. It's being distributed in large amounts. We have it coming in now. We're up to 29 million doses; then we went to 30 million doses. But we have it coming in all throughout the country, and much of it's being distributed. In fact, it'll start going down, what we have in our stockpile."
2950,2020-04-05,"And, again, it's had — you know, I — I hope it works. Again, I'm not a doctor, as you possibly have found out. I'm not a doctor, but I'm a person with common sense."
2951,2020-04-05,And we've had some very good results over the course —
2952,2020-04-05,— including a woman who just reported it two days ago.
2953,2020-04-05,Yes?
2954,2020-04-05,"I think no. We're looking — we're looking to provide it in many different ways. In many ways, we're — in certain instances, we've been asked — in the case of Michigan, we've been asked who the governor of Michigan would like to — I think she's become a big fan of it as a medication, as a — as something that's going to help with this horrible virus. And we're delivering it to the governments of various states when they ask. So certain states are asking, certain governments are asking, and we're delivering it directly to the government."
2955,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Go ahead."
2956,2020-04-05,Yes. Yes.
2957,2020-04-05,Good. Where are you from?
2958,2020-04-05,Where are you from?
2959,2020-04-05,Good.
2960,2020-04-05,Medical goods?
2961,2020-04-05,That doesn't bother me.
2962,2020-04-05,"No, if they're sending medical goods to Iran, it doesn't bother me. Okay?"
2963,2020-04-05,I did see that today.
2964,2020-04-05,"Well, he didn't really drop out. He didn't really — what about his delegates? I mean, he — he said he's going to keep his delegates and — which is sort of interesting. He's going to keep his delegates, and he'd like to get more now."
2965,2020-04-05,"Now, is he dropping out or not? That's not dropping out. When you keep your delegates and then you want more delegates before you get to the convention, that's a weird deal going on there. I don't know what's happening."
2966,2020-04-05,And I don't know why President Obama hasn't supported Joe Biden a long time ago. There is something he feels is wrong. Why isn't — he'll come out. I'm sure he's got to come out at some point because he certainly doesn't want to see me for four more years. We're not — we think a little bit differently.
2967,2020-04-05,"You know what? I'll tell you, it does amaze me that President Obama hasn't supported Sleepy Joe. It just hasn't happened. When is it going to happen? When is it going to happen? Why isn't he? He knows something that you don't know, that I think I know, but you don't know. So it'll be interesting."
2968,2020-04-05,"But with Bernie, I saw his standard fare today. I watched. And I hope that a lot of Bernie Sanders's people, just like they did last time — we got a tremendous percentage of Bernie people. And I think they voted for me largely because of trade, because Bernie and I agree on trade. We agree that the United States has been ripped off by virtually every country they do business with. The difference is I've done a lot about it, and I'm doing more about it. And we've made incredible trade deals, including USMCA, the deal with China, and then, all of a sudden, that gets disturbed by this virus situation."
2969,2020-04-05,"But China has to spend almost $250 billion on purchasing our products, $40- to $50 billion with our farmers. And the Bernie Sanders people are big believers on what I'm saying on trade. And I got a lot of them in the last election. That surprised people, but it didn't surprise me."
2970,2020-04-05,"No, those are great people. They're great people. But I — I just — look, I'm looking at Bernie Sanders. I watched this morning, and I said, “What is that all about?” Like, you saw that — the delegates. The delegates. He's not giving up his delegates. He's keeping them, and he said he wants to get more of them. And I think he's doing it to negotiate, I assume. But I don't know, that's — that's a hard thing to do."
2971,2020-04-05,"Yeah, Jeff, go ahead."
2972,2020-04-05,Yeah.
2973,2020-04-05,"Oh, that's good. Finally —"
2974,2020-04-05,— somebody knows something when they ask a question.
2975,2020-04-05,"I don't think. Look, we already cut. You know, we're, like, very market-oriented. If you look at Texas and if you look at North Dakota, and if you look at some of our states that do this very well, they've already cut way back. You know, they cut back automatically."
2976,2020-04-05,"But in the case of Russia, in the case of Saudi Arabia, they increased production at a time when you didn't need it, and then they got hit by the virus, which knocked out 40 percent of the market. And now they're flooded with oil."
2977,2020-04-05,"Look I — I just say this: You have two countries that are getting hurt very badly. Russia is getting hurt, and that's their primary source. And Saudi Arabia, that's their –definitely their primary source. And it doesn't make sense that they flooded the market. For whatever reason, they did that for themselves. It's a argument that they had. And I think they'll straighten it out."
2978,2020-04-05,"A lot of progress has been made over the last week, and it'll be interesting to see what comes out of OPEC tomorrow. But OPEC, obviously — for many years, I used to think OPEC was very unfair. I hated OPEC. You want to know the truth? I hated it, because it was a fix. But somewhere along the line, that broke down and it went the opposite way."
2979,2020-04-05,And we have a tremendously powerful energy industry in this country now. Number one in the world. And I don't want those jobs being lost. Okay?
2980,2020-04-05,"We'll see. I mean, I have a lot of options."
2981,2020-04-05,Please.
2982,2020-04-05,"Got a lot of good options, Jeff. Beauties. I might like it even more."
2983,2020-04-05,"No, you'll. Let's see what happens. Hopefully they can make a deal."
2984,2020-04-05,Let's go.
2985,2020-04-05,I agree.
2986,2020-04-05,Including me.
2987,2020-04-05,"You said adjusted back down 61,000. What was adjusted back?"
2988,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Go ahead. It's still a big number, right? Sixty-one. Right?"
2989,2020-04-05,That's a big number. Go ahead.
2990,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't want to do that. Look, I had a date, and I thought it was a very aspirational day. It's turning out to be very interesting, because a lot of good things are happening by Easter. But I had a very aspirational date. I didn't think you could make it. I didn't say we would do it by Easter, but I said, “Boy, wouldn't it be great to shoot for Easter”? That would be a great day, a beautiful day, a very important day to a lot of people like me and like some of you in the room. Maybe all of you in the room, frankly."
2991,2020-04-05,"But Easter is a very important day. So I had — aspirationally, I said, “Let's see if we can do it at Easter.” You know, but I said it would be very tough. And I was criticized for that, so I don't like giving dates. And that wasn't a date, that was just an aspiration. That would have been incredible."
2992,2020-04-05,"But I don't think we're going to be very far behind. And some of these models are looking like Easter is going to be a very important date anyway because of the curve. I mean, it's hitting the top, and it's starting to come down. And one person said Easter is looking like a good time. So a good time for that, for heading down. So we'll see what happens."
2993,2020-04-05,"Look, there's no reason to do that. We have a lot of good things happening. When I spoke to the governor of Louisiana, he said, “Tony, they need far less beds than they needed.” I said, “Well, good, because we're building 1,000-room additional.” We built them 1,000 — the beds. And now we're building another thousand."
2994,2020-04-05,"And I said, “Listen, is there a way that we don't build — I don't want to build them if they don't need them.” In New York, the Javits isn't too heavily used; it's ready to go — 2,900 beds — plus, we now have the ship set for COVID if they want to use it. And we're using it for governor Murphy in New Jersey. So we'll see what happens."
2995,2020-04-05,"But, you know, the numbers are coming way down. The ventilators, we're all set. We have a lot to go if we want. But we're not getting — I'm not getting calls where they need ventilators anymore. So we were right on those ventilators."
2996,2020-04-05,"I'd love to have additional ventilators for some of the countries that are our allies and our friends. And even if they're not our allies and our friends, you're saving human lives. But I'd love to see if we had some — I mean, we're making a lot of ventilators right now. We have a — and they take a while to make, and they're very expensive and they're very complex to make. But I'd love to be able to help other countries once we're taken care of."
2997,2020-04-05,"But I just sent 100 ventilators to Colorado, and that was great. A senator there who is a terrific senator — Cory and — Cory Gardner. And he called me last night. He said, “Could you get 100 ventilators for Colorado?” And we just sent them out, and there'll be there very shortly."
2998,2020-04-05,"So — but it looks like we're in great shape from the bed standpoint. It looks like we're in great shape from the ventilator standpoint. And you just heard, I ordered 500 million masks — 500 N95s and others — and surgical. But we ordered 500 million masks: 300 and 200. And they're going to be here very shortly."
2999,2020-04-05,"So, we're really in great shape, and we started off with an empty cupboard."
3000,2020-04-05,So I'm going to leave the Vice President and his group to handle it. And I will see you probably tomorrow. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
3001,2020-04-05,"No, I don't."
3002,2020-04-05,"No, I don't. Thanks. Good question."
3003,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, everybody. I'd like to begin by saying that we just completed a meeting with the Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao on proposals regarding the airlines and the airline business."
3004,2020-04-05,"And we're working very closely with a lot of different people. We'll be probably putting out a proposal and giving them some of the details — some of the very powerful details over the weekend. It's moving along quickly. The airline business has been hit very hard, as everybody knows. And we are going to be in a position to do a lot to help them so that they keep their employees and they save their businesses."
3005,2020-04-05,"And that'll be taking place, I think you can say, over the weekend. We may even have discussions with some of the airlines or all of the airlines over the weekend. And I think it's going to be a very acceptable package. It's a very big package and a very acceptable package. It'll be good for our country, good for the airlines, good for a lot of people."
3006,2020-04-05,"Likewise, I just spoke with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman, and we had a big talk as to oil production and OPEC and making it so that our industry does well and the oil industry does better than it's doing right now. It's — the numbers are so low that there'll be layoffs all over the world. There'll be certainly layoffs in this country. And we don't want that to happen."
3007,2020-04-05,"We built a great, great energy business in the United States. So we have tens of thousands of jobs. We had a very good talk; we'll see what happens. But as you know, OPEC met today, and I would say they're getting close to a deal. We'll soon find out. So that was a conversation we just had, so we had a busy hour and a half."
3008,2020-04-05,"And let me begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to the American people. Millions of Americans are making profound and difficult sacrifices in their own lives because they know it will save the lives of countless others. And that's exactly what it's doing. You see what's happening and where we are and where we stand. And hopefully we're going to be opening up — you can call it “opening” very, very — very, very soon, I hope."
3009,2020-04-05,"Together, our people are writing one of the most noble chapters in the proud history of our nation. Americans are also encouraged to learn that Boris Johnson, Prime Minister, has been moved out of intensive care. That's a tremendous statement. And we continue to pray for him and his fast recovery. That's a very — a very positive development."
3010,2020-04-05,"As the New York metropolitan area continues its battle against the outbreak, the full power of the federal government is there to support them. As you know, the Javits Center has now been fully converted into a 3,000-bed hospital — one of the largest anywhere in the country — and by the incredible professionals."
3011,2020-04-05,"I have to say, the Corps of Engineers, what they can do is just incredible. They've done a fantastic job and they're building, nationwide, 21 temporary hospitals and care facilities, adding 17,000 hospital beds. And they did that all within a very short period of time. It's incredible what they've done. Army Corps of Engineers. And FEMA has been fantastic."
3012,2020-04-05,"Our sweeping airlift operation to keep doctors and nurses supplied with protective equipment, Project Airbridge, continues to expand with more than 24 flights already completed and 49 additional flights now scheduled in the near future. So that's been very successful. And that gear and those outfits are being handed out. As they arrive, they're going directly to point."
3013,2020-04-05,"The American medical system continues to perform beyond our highest expectations, reminding us that the United States is blessed with the most advanced healthcare and the most skilled healthcare workers anywhere in the planet. Other countries are looking to what we're doing. And our testing operation has now become far and away the most sophisticated and the best anywhere."
3014,2020-04-05,"And we want to thank all of the heroes on the frontlines as they fight to save American lives. We're at the top of the hill. Pretty sure we're at the top of the hill, and now we're going downward. In some cases, we've already started that process."
3015,2020-04-05,"Earlier today, I spoke with hundreds of mental health leaders and advocates from around the country to discuss the vital work and the vital work they're doing. We had the top doctors in the country, some international doctors. Mental health — big factor. Not only has the virus inflicted immense physical suffering on many people, but also mental and emotional suffering as well. Even though we're staying physically apart, no American is alone, and we're all in this together. But the mental health doctors and experts — it was a very great call. It was a very interesting call. They're working very hard."
3016,2020-04-05,"We're also seeing encouraging signs in our race to develop breakthrough treatments and therapies. Pfizer revealed today that it has found a promising new treatment that might prevent the virus from replicating. And that hopes — it hopes to begin testing in clinical trials very soon. It's going to be very, very soon. They have great — great feelings for this particular therapy, and they think that a lot of good things are happening."
3017,2020-04-05,"Through the FDA's Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program, 19 therapies and treatments are now being tested and 26 more are in the active planning or [for] clinical trial. So we have 19 therapies being tested currently, and 26 more are in the active planning for clinical trials. That's a big statement. That's a lot."
3018,2020-04-05,"Trials for Gilead's antiviral drug, remdesivir, continue. And the company has also expanded emergency use for new patients getting good, early results, by the way. The companies that manufacture hydroxychloroquine are massively ramping up production."
3019,2020-04-05,"As you know, many people are recommending, strongly, Z-Pak be added — the Z-Pak — and also zinc. And the federal government continues to build our stockpiles and distribute millions of doses for doctors to use as they see fit."
3020,2020-04-05,"And I'm pleased to inform you — we're just having — a lot of good things are happening, but we'll have to see how that all works out. But we have — we've purchased and we have stockpiled millions and millions of doses, and we're distributing it. Some states want it very badly. Michigan — we just sent a lot to Michigan and other areas."
3021,2020-04-05,"I'm reporting today that we passed 2 million tests completed in the United States, first time — most anywhere in the country. It's a milestone for our country. It's a milestone anywhere. Nobody has done anywhere close. Our tests are highly sophisticated and highly accurate."
3022,2020-04-05,"At the same time, we're making important progress on the economic front of this war. In a few moments, Secretary of Labor, Eugene Scalia, will explain new steps that we're taking to ensure American workers swiftly receive unemployment and paid leave benefits and that employers protect the health and safety of all workers, including essential workers on the job, working very, very closely with workers and with employers."
3023,2020-04-05,"To provide further economic relief, the Federal Reserve announced this morning that it'll provide up to $2.3 trillion in support to businesses, states, and local governments. Six hundred billion dollars in loans will be available for mid-sized businesses with up to 10,000 employees. And $500 billion will be available for states, counties with over 2 million residents and cities with a population of over 1 million."
3024,2020-04-05,"My administration is also working with Congress to replenish the very successful — incredibly successful the way it's going — Paycheck Protection Program, which is allowing hundreds of thousands of small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll, meaning it'll keep those businesses open."
3025,2020-04-05,"We need both Democrats and Republicans to come together to get this leg- — the legislation completed. And it looks like it's on its way, but we need both. And it should be for people that are working for the workers. And if you look and you see, we have a lot of people that are affected by that, and it's a very positive development. So we have to get a bipartisan approval of that. And hopefully that'll happen."
3026,2020-04-05,"Today, the Department of Education is also announcing the availability of more than $6 billion in emergency grant funding to assist college students impacted by the cancellation of classes and the suspension of housing. A lot of people had a lot of things suspended; housing is one of them."
3027,2020-04-05,"Previously, we waived student loan payments for six months. So, student loan payments have been waived for six months, and we'll discuss it after that. It may go further."
3028,2020-04-05,"Although this medical war has separated our citizens for a period of time, it's also united our entire nation, I think I can say, like almost never before. Americans are moving forward with common purpose and shared resolve, determined to vanquish the virus and lift our nation to even greater heights. We are supremely confident in the magnificent future that awaits the American people."
3029,2020-04-05,"And with that, before I invite our Vice President — our great Vice President — and Gene Scalia to speak, we'll take a few questions. And then I'm going back into negotiations on oil and on airlines."
3030,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
3031,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I had a very good conversation."
3032,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3033,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Yeah. No, there's a lot of — there's a lot of — there's so much production, nobody even knows what to do with it. That's how it's working."
3034,2020-04-05,"And Saudi Arabia and, as you know, Russia — it's well known that we're producing a lot, and they were perhaps fighting with each other over the production and the amount of oil being produced. And, frankly, there's not enough room to even store it. Our storage is now full — going to be very soon. Our Strategic National storage is — I said this is a great time to fill it up, load it up with oil that, frankly, is — had pricing that nobody has ever seen before. I don't think we've seen this probably since the 1950s. That was with big dollars. So we'll see what happens."
3035,2020-04-05,The conversation was very good. They're getting close to a deal; that's OPEC and many other countries outside of OPEC. And we'll see what happens.
3036,2020-04-05,"No, I think they were getting along very well. We had a very good — we had a very good call. I think it was a very good call. We're going to see what happens, but it was a very good call. They'll probably announce something either today or tomorrow, one way or the other. Could be good. Could be not so good. But I think one way or the other —"
3037,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Jim."
3038,2020-04-05,No.
3039,2020-04-05,"No. We have a great testing system. We have the best — right now, the best testing system in the world. But there are certain sections —"
3040,2020-04-05,"There are certain sections in the country that are in phenomenal shape already. Other sections are coming online; other sections are going down. And we, in addition to that, are giving out millions of tests. And every day, we're doing it exponentially. We're picking up. And what we'll be doing in the very near future is going to certain areas of our country and do massive testing. It's not necessary, but it would be a good thing to have."
3041,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
3042,2020-04-05,"We want to have it, and we're going to see if we have it. Do you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes. We're talking about 325 million people. And that's not going to happen, as you can imagine. And no — it would never happen with anyone else either. Other countries do it, but they do it in a limited form. We'll probably be the leader of the pack."
3043,2020-04-05,Please.
3044,2020-04-05,"Well, I think the economy is going to do very well. Now, that's just my feeling. It's a strong feeling. I've had good, proper feelings about a lot of things over the years. And I think we're going to do well."
3045,2020-04-05,"We're doing very — it looks like we're at the lower end of the curve in terms of death, which is a terrible word, a terrible, dark word that we've experienced like nobody has ever seen before in this country. I mean, we have numbers that are terrible. But when you look at the lower levels of 100- — lower prediction levels of 100- — 120,000 to 220,000 — or, if we did nothing, up to 2.2 million people — we're looking at a much lower level than the level of — I hope than the level of 100,000. So we're going to see."
3046,2020-04-05,"We're going to have to — you can never — look, you can never do anything about the people that lost their loved ones and love their — lost their friends. And, I mean, the great friendships. And I'm not sure a lot of people will ever be the same."
3047,2020-04-05,"But I think our country, from an economic standpoint, will end up being stronger than ever. We have tremendous stimulus. We have tremendous stimulus plans. We have things in the works that are going to really, I think, fire the country."
3048,2020-04-05,"I think that what's going to happen is we're going to have a big bounce rather than a small bounce. But we will be back. And I think — honestly, I think our country is going to be back, from an economic standpoint — again, you can never replace the people that were lost. And to their families, certainly you can never do a thing like that."
3049,2020-04-05,"But we will have succeeded in many ways, hopefully keeping the number way below our minimum numbers. And also, from an economic standpoint — you know, we met with the mental health people today, and that takes a trem- — this has taken a tremendous toll, mentally, on a lot of people. And I think we're going to open up strong. I think we're going to open up very successfully, and, I'd like to say, even more successfully than before."
3050,2020-04-05,Please.
3051,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3052,2020-04-05,"Well, I want to see it where there's a certain market, but I also don't want — I don't want to see it where people are — have no idea — you know, we're opening up — we'll be opening up areas for storage of oil — massive areas for storage of oil — because oil today is not selling."
3053,2020-04-05,And what happened is the virus knocked out 40 percent of the market immediate- — you know that; you know the number. Forty percent.
3054,2020-04-05,"Now, there was a lot of oil, but it was very controllable. All of a sudden, they lost 40 percent. You look at the roads, you look at the car — you look at what's going on; there's nobody driving. There's no reason for it right now. That'll start coming back."
3055,2020-04-05,"But we are storing millions of barrels of oil that nobody thought would even be possible. Frankly, ships turned out to be a good business for some people because they're filling up tankers, sending them out to sea, and not saying where to go. They're just sitting out there loaded up with oil."
3056,2020-04-05,"So we want to save our energy. In this country, we want to make sure that our energy companies, businesses, and employees, workers remain strong. So that's how I'm involved. And I think that's going to happen."
3057,2020-04-05,"So right now, if you look, you're probably talking $23, $25. If they announce a deal, we can get it up. We need a minimum number so the companies don't go out of business, so they're not going to lay off all of these energy workers who are important to our country."
3058,2020-04-05,"And, you know, we're now energy independent. We could do something where we only used our oil. But I think the long-term benefit is to be able to just go with the market. And it's going to work out. It's all going to work out. If you looked at three weeks ago, as you know, because we talked about it, three weeks ago and two weeks ago, this was catastrophic. I think it's really hitting bottom, and I think that — I mean, we've had a bottom. But now at $23 and $25 and probably heading up. At the same time, we save our energy and we also produce great, cheap energy and we save our jobs."
3059,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3060,2020-04-05,"I don't think there's a fault. We're — they're doing record numbers of — of dollars. They're dealing with many community banks. They're dealing with Bank of America, Citibank, a lot of — Wells Fargo, as you know, is very much involved. And they're dealing with the bankers. It can't go that quickly but I'm hearing it's a very, very successful rollout."
3061,2020-04-05,"They did want changes in applications. They want changes in loan requirements, et cetera. But they're taking billions and billions of dollars' worth of loans. And in the very near future, the banks will be relieving the money. They'll be paying out the money."
3062,2020-04-05,Yeah. Please.
3063,2020-04-05,"Well, we have a deal. Yeah. The deal is with Canada. We're deal- — with Mexico, we have a deal. And obviously the deal is different from the standpoint that production will be lower. But we have a deal. It's a signed deal. It's a deal that's a — one of the worst deals that we've ever had was NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals ever made by any country anywhere, and we'll be terminating that. And the new deal is a great deal for our country. So, that's something."
3064,2020-04-05,"Now, again, we got hit by the virus, and we'll see where that all goes. But certainly, car production is going to be down for a little while. But, ultimately, good for our farmers, great for our farmers. We'll be helping our farmers, by the way. We have money going out to our farmers in the pretty near future, having to do with — you see what's happened. The farmers got hurt very badly by all of this. People are eating less from the standpoint that there's — no restaurants are open, no businesses are open, no hotels are open. They'll start to come back. But we're going to be helping out our farmers."
3065,2020-04-05,Yeah. Please.
3066,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
3067,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3068,2020-04-05,No.
3069,2020-04-05,"No, I'm not, because we're — we're in very good shape. You'll be speaking with Mike Pence about this in a little while."
3070,2020-04-05,"You look at the hospitals, you look at what's going on — I spoke to — yesterday, I spoke with the governor of Louisiana. I'm saying, “Do you think we need that extra thousand beds that we're in the process of building?” We are really in good shape. You're not hearing people are needing ventilators much. In fact, we're going to start helping other countries with ventilators. We're going to end up having a lot of ventilators for future, should something happen for hospitals — ideally to keep and have."
3071,2020-04-05,"But, no, I think we're in very, very good shape. We have calls with governors all the time. And the governors are in very good shape now. We have helped — we have sent billions and billions and billions of dollars between ventilators, equipment, protective equipment, masks. We have 500 million masks coming — 500 million from one group. Five hundred. It'll be 300 million and 200 million over a short period of time."
3072,2020-04-05,"No, I think we're in very good shape."
3073,2020-04-05,Please.
3074,2020-04-05,"Yeah. I don't like using the word “needed” because I don't think it's “needed,” but I think we're going to try and hit a number like that. That's a very high number, but we're going to be trying to hit it, and we probably might be able to do that."
3075,2020-04-05,Please. Go ahead.
3076,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
3077,2020-04-05,"I do. And I do support something, but I support it for the next phase. It's much simpler in the next phase, whether that phase is infrastructure or whatever."
3078,2020-04-05,So I'm going to leave you now with Mike Pence and with Eugene Scalia. And if you would — I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. We'll see you tomorrow. We have a lot of — I think a lot of very big news to report. We've had a tremendous day between I believe what's happening with the energy industry and I believe what's happening with airlines.
3079,2020-04-05,"I look forward to seeing you. Thank you very much, everybody."
3080,2020-04-05,"I just had a meeting with Kevin McCarthy, future Speaker of the House, I hope. And he's done a fantastic job for the people of California. And also, the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you look at the — at the bump. You take a look at the bump and how they're doing out there. So I congratulate everybody out there."
3081,2020-04-05,"But I thought I'd have Kevin say a few words. So, Kevin, please."
3082,2020-04-05,Thank you. Great job you're doing.
3083,2020-04-05,Thank you. You go ahead. I'll talk to you later.
3084,2020-04-05,"Okay, thank you very much, everybody. And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America. That seems to be the hotspot right now. But you have some others, as you know, that are very — very bad. Very bad. Louisiana is getting hit very hard. Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard. New Jersey is — is –surprisingly, it's much greater than anybody would have thought. They're doing a really good job. The governor is doing a really good job out there."
3085,2020-04-05,"New York's first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure. They're the best in the world. We will take every action and we'll spare no resource — financial, medical, scientific. We will not spare anything. We'll get it back into shape."
3086,2020-04-05,"The Empire State — the governor is doing an excellent job. They're all working very hard together. At the request of the governor, as you know, the Javits Center, we have 2,500 beds, and we're going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after, the patients can be looked after. That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents. And, you know, it's very interesting, the governor is telling me we don't have too many accidents and very few people driving."
3087,2020-04-05,"So we're going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility. The ship will be staying the way it is, but we're putting that facility into play to help them."
3088,2020-04-05,"And today, also, the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus. From recent studies, we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood. So you don't seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred."
3089,2020-04-05,"In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it's voluntary; you don't have to do it. They suggested for a period of time. But this is voluntary. I don't think I'm going to be doing it."
3090,2020-04-05,But you have a lot of ways — you can look at it as follows: The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or a fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home. Probably material that you'd have at home. These face coverings can be easily washed or reused.
3091,2020-04-05,"I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical-grade or surgical-grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job. Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services."
3092,2020-04-05,"The new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC's guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time. Again, we're going to all come back together here. We're going to all come back together. And practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway."
3093,2020-04-05,"A lot of things, I think, are going to spill over. Shaking hands maybe will stay with our country for a long time beyond this. One of the — one of our great doctors was telling me that — as you know, we have flus every year, and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial. And said that if they didn't shake hands, that number would be substantially lower. So maybe it'll stay. Maybe some of these things, long term, will be good. But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection."
3094,2020-04-05,"So with the masks, it's going to be, really, a voluntary thing. You can do it. You don't have to do it. I'm choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it, and that's okay. It may be good. Probably will. They're making a recommendation. It's only a recommendation. It's voluntary."
3095,2020-04-05,"We're also taking action to ensure the cost of no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus. The largest insurer nationwide, the BlueCross BlueShield System, has now announced that it will not require any co-pays — which is really something; that's a tremendous statement — from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days, similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem. Those are great companies, and they're all doing the same thing. So, co-pays. For them to do that is — it's a big statement. We appreciate it."
3096,2020-04-05,"Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the economic relief package Congress passed last month. So that was as per the question yesterday and actually the day before yesterday. This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment. So that's, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people."
3097,2020-04-05,I'm also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers.
3098,2020-04-05,"The security and Secretary — the Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment. We need these items immediately for domestic use. We have to have them. But we've done really well with the purchase of items, and you'll be hearing about that shortly."
3099,2020-04-05,"We've already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies. Under that authority, this week, the Department of Health and Human Services, working with the Department of Justice, took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves, as well as bottles — many, many, many bottles — and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded. All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers. Most of it has already been given out. And we've given a lot to New York, a lot in New Jersey, a lot to other places."
3100,2020-04-05,"In addition to ensure that healthcare workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government, in the name of the Department of Defense, is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators. Department of Defense. And we've already given 200,000 of them to New York City. Mayor de Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor de Blasio in New York City. And they were very grateful. 8.1 million. And we're going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more. That's a lot of N95 respirators."
3101,2020-04-05,"Today, my team spoke with the CEO of Ochsner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans. They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators — I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators — and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we've been doing with them, working with them."
3102,2020-04-05,"The CEO of Ochsner, Warner Thomas — who's really been fantastic, I have to say — indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns. And I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow. So they'll have the 230,000. That's Louisiana — New Orleans. Two hundred and thirty thousand surgical gowns; they'll have them by tomorrow."
3103,2020-04-05,We're expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military. And we are in a war. The invisible enemy — remember.
3104,2020-04-05,"Over 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation's call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country, like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits, where we take it over. And we're going to have that manned by the military, because it's very tough to get people — more people in the New York area. So we're going to have it manned by the military — Javits Center."
3105,2020-04-05,"National Guard members have been activated to help states build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies. That includes National Guard. The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the states were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies. So I've given approval to use the National Guards — the various National Guards in the different states. And they're doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people but delivering material."
3106,2020-04-05,"The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 states and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many states: in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington Wisconsin, Ohio. They're doing a lot of work in just those states, plus additionals, that are being — will be announced probably tomorrow. But they're doing some job. The Army Corps of Engineers — what a job they're doing. And FEMA — what a job they're doing."
3107,2020-04-05,"As we deploy the power of our military, we're also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers. We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies, and the treatment and prevention of the virus. And we will keep the American people fully informed on our findings. Hydroxychloroquine — I don't know, it's looking like it's having some good results. I hope that — that would be a phenomenal thing."
3108,2020-04-05,"But we have it right now in — approximately now, it's increased to 1,500 people. I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York — terrific guy, by the way. He's — we're doing a good job. And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it. So it's been there for about three and a half days, but I think — and many other places it's being tested too. And we have a tremendous supply of it. We've ordered it in the case that it works. And it's — it could have some pretty big impacts. And we'll see what happens."
3109,2020-04-05,"My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses. On day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5. billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during the unprecedented time — this unprecedented time."
3110,2020-04-05,"And Bank of America has been incredible. Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks. And we're already at $3.5 billion going out to incredible people. But that's way ahead of schedule."
3111,2020-04-05,"The SBA and the Treasury are working around the clock, and our banking partners are really incredible. And they're ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible, and then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go, and now they'll keep them. And that's good. And then they're going to open for business and they're going to have their employees. And we'll try and get back to where we were. Eventually, we're going to supersede where we were."
3112,2020-04-05,"The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis. This afternoon, I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hager of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil. I informed them that we will be making space available in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time."
3113,2020-04-05,"There's a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus. The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil. So we're working with our great energy companies. These are great companies. They employ tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. And they've kept America really going for a long time. And no big price hikes, no big anything. I mean, they've just kept it going. And now they got hit. But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we're going to make sure that they stay in good shape."
3114,2020-04-05,"America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society. Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time. And we want them to stay healthy for a long time. So stay at home. This is ending. This will end. You'll see some bad things and then you're going to see some really good things. And it's not going to be too long."
3115,2020-04-05,"We will heal our citizens and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus."
3116,2020-04-05,"And with that, I'd like to ask Mike Pence to come up, Vice President, and say a few words. And we'll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we'll take questions."
3117,2020-04-05,"And it's a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C., and our country is a great place, and we're getting better. We're getting better very quickly."
3118,2020-04-05,"This was artificially induced. We just said — they said, “Close it down. You have to close it down.” We closed it down and we're healing. We're going to get it better fast."
3119,2020-04-05,"So, Mike, if you could come up say a few words. Please."
3120,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
3121,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Okay, let's go. Steve?"
3122,2020-04-05,"Well, I just don't want to wear one myself. It's a recommendation; they recommend it. I'm feeling good. I just don't want to be doing — I don't know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk — the great Resolute Desk — I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don't know. Somehow, I don't see it for myself. I just — I just don't. Maybe I'll change my mind, but this will pass and hopefully it'll pass very quickly."
3123,2020-04-05,"Now, with that being said, if somebody wants to — I mean, most people can just make something out of a certain material. So it's very well designated, it's very simple to do. I won't be doing it personally. It's a recommendation. Okay?"
3124,2020-04-05,And would you like to say something about that?
3125,2020-04-05,"Surgeon General, please."
3126,2020-04-05,Thank you. Thank you.
3127,2020-04-05,Great job. Thank you.
3128,2020-04-05,Okay. Jon?
3129,2020-04-05,"I leave it up to the governors. The governors know what they're doing. They've been doing a great job. I guess we're close to 90 percent anyway. And the states that we're talking about are not in jeopardy. No, I would leave it to the governors. I like — I like that from the standpoint of governing, and I like that from the standpoint of even our Constitution."
3130,2020-04-05,Please.
3131,2020-04-05,"Well, I pointed to him. Right?"
3132,2020-04-05,I knew we (inaudible). I heard a different voice. I heard a different voice.
3133,2020-04-05,Go ahead. We'll get you later.
3134,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3135,2020-04-05,"Well, a lot of things came out. It's a great industry, it's an important industry, it's a tremendous job-producing industry. And it's just vital. And it was also very interesting because they all were given the test before they came into the room. So you have the head of Exxon Mobil, you have all these guys taking the test, and they all passed with flying colors. So that was good. They left happy, in that respect, at least."
3136,2020-04-05,"There's just an overabundance of oil right now — oil and gas. Tremendous overabundance. And it was caused — they were doing a great job. They were producing a lot of energy. But then you have the virus come along and it knocked another 35 percent, maybe 40 percent, off of the market."
3137,2020-04-05,So there's too much oil. There's a glut. And these are great companies and they'll figure it out. It's free market. We'll figure it out.
3138,2020-04-05,And with the Crown Prince. Both.
3139,2020-04-05,They were having a competition. We'll see how it all works out. I think it's going to work out very well. It's going to take a long time to — to get rid of that. There's massive excess amount of oil and gas. Massive. Like probably there's never been.
3140,2020-04-05,"So where that does work out well, I guess you could say, is for drivers. I think, in certain locations, it's down to 90 and 95 cents a gallon, right now, on the road."
3141,2020-04-05,"But we have a tremendous industry, a great industry. A tremendously important industry from the standpoint of jobs. And we're energy independent. We have to make sure we keep it that way."
3142,2020-04-05,"All right, please. Go ahead."
3143,2020-04-05,"No, I didn't know anything about that. That was done by the FDA — very capable people at the FDA."
3144,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
3145,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3146,2020-04-05,I don't blame them. They can push back if they want.
3147,2020-04-05,We're not happy with 3M. We're not happy. And the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with 3M.
3148,2020-04-05,So we'll see whether or not we do. I heard what he had to say today. I don't know the gentleman. But we're not happy with 3M. Go ahead.
3149,2020-04-05,"I don't know. But every time you ask that question — whenever he's not here, you look, you say, “Where is he?” And you'll say, “Is there a problem?” No problem whatsoever. Every time he's not here — sometimes I'll ask him to come because that's the first question that you and a couple of others from the fake news establishment ask, is: “Where is Dr. Fauci?” We're doing great together."
3150,2020-04-05,Except we're covering a different subject today.
3151,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
3152,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Jim. Try another one."
3153,2020-04-05,"Well, I always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things that could happen. There's been nothing like this since probably 1917. That was the big one in Europe. It started actually here and went to Europe. Probably. I've heard about —"
3154,2020-04-05,Excuse me. Wait a minute. Let me finish. I've heard about this for a long time — pandemics. You don't want pandemics. And I don't think he was talking about a specific pandemic. He was talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen. And it could happen. Most people thought it wouldn't and most people didn't understand the severity of it. This is a very severe. What's happened is very severe. But I'd let you answer that. I assume that he was talking about the concept of a pandemic.
3155,2020-04-05,Previous administrations gave us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space. Let me just tell you —
3156,2020-04-05,You know it —
3157,2020-04-05,You know the answer.
3158,2020-04-05,"The previous administration, the shelves were empty. The shelves were empty."
3159,2020-04-05,"So what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration, Jim, and ask them that question, because —"
3160,2020-04-05,— the shelves were empty.
3161,2020-04-05,"And you know what else? The military shelves were also empty. We had no ammunition, literally. And that was said by one of your favorite generals. “We have — sir, we have no ammunition.” Guess what? We had very little medical supply also."
3162,2020-04-05,"All right. Go ahead, please."
3163,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
3164,2020-04-05,We'll get it back. We'll get you back.
3165,2020-04-05,"We'll get you back, please."
3166,2020-04-05,"Jim, I said we'll get you back."
3167,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
3168,2020-04-05,It covers everything.
3169,2020-04-05,"But if somebody ordered — if Italy, if Spain, who has big problems — these have — these are countries with tremendous problems — France. If they ordered — if they have long-term orders and they're in in there and they want to get certain things, I've let them go out, in certain instances, because I think it's only fair. They have problems that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems. So if they ordered something and they're waiting for, as an example, masks made here and going to Italy, I'm not going to be stopping that. I think it would be very unfair."
3170,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, speaking about being fair and unfair, two very big cruise liners, as you know, I allowed them to dock today. We worked with the governor of Florida, as you know, Ron DeSantis, and we worked on it and we had tremendous security."
3171,2020-04-05,"And we took the sick people and we're working with them. We have doctors. We have great doctors, military doctors. And from a humane standpoint, not that we're in love with this — these are two massive ships — but we have to take care of people. We have to take care."
3172,2020-04-05,"We sent many back to Canada. The Canada — the Canadians came and worked very closely with us, as did the UK. We had a lot of people from the UK. And we take — we took care of the Americans. We took care of the sick. We had some people very sick. I think we have three to four, maybe five people that had died on the boat. One of the boats, actually. And we had to take care of these people."
3173,2020-04-05,"So we couldn't let them float aimlessly into the ocean, looking for port, as they've been doing for a long time. And I made the decision: We had to take them in. And Homeland Security and a lot of other people did a great job."
3174,2020-04-05,"But we had to help people. These are people that were very, very sick. Some were dying. Some died."
3175,2020-04-05,Please.
3176,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Yeah. Go ahead.
3177,2020-04-05,"No, I'm not concerned. No. I had a test yesterday."
3178,2020-04-05,"I don't know. I mean, I just — I heard from the oil executives. These are people — most of them had not had the test. And, frankly, I think they left the room feeling good about a lot of things. But they felt good about the test."
3179,2020-04-05,"This was a test that took, I guess, 13 minutes to have it finalized. They took the test. I don't know. I didn't know they were doing that. Maybe they did it just for them. I don't know. But —"
3180,2020-04-05,"— it seems that a lot of people — because now we have tests that really work well. Abbott, in this case. Abbott. We have other tests being developed right now that are also fantastic."
3181,2020-04-05,"The original test — the ones we inherited, Jim, as an example, they were — they were broken. They were obsolete. They were not good tests. And that's what we got stuck with. We've developed some incredible tests. But this took 13 to 15 minutes. And they were all fine."
3182,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Finish — finish your question.
3183,2020-04-05,Sure.
3184,2020-04-05,"Well, I address it in the following manner: We really are very well supplied. We are not the principal — it's the hospitals, the states, the cities. They're supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens. But nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened, so we started supplying."
3185,2020-04-05,"We brought tremendous amounts to New York today and over the last few days. We brought them to Louisiana. We brought them to Michigan. We brought them to Los Angeles. A lot of equipment. You've read the amount of masks that we had. I think I said over 8 million masks. The N95 masks. The, you know, more expensive, more complicated, better, whatever masks — the ones they want to use in the hospitals."
3186,2020-04-05,"We have millions of them now, and we've given them to a lot. We sent to Bellevue, in New York today — that was for Mayor de Blasio — 200,000 of them. But we have 8.1 million; we're going to have more than that. And we're getting them from various sources, including the military. We're rapidly then replacing them, because we have to replace them in case there's a — another emergency. I would be — gowns too. We have many gowns being delivered and have been delivered."
3187,2020-04-05,"Our people have done an incredible job. Most people have said — now, and I said this yesterday — governors have said, “Thank you very much. Great job.” If they're a Democrat governor — in some cases; not in all cases at all — if I said, “Here's 1,000 ventilators. How many do you want?” “We want 1,000.” “Here's 1,000. You got 'em. But you know what we're going to do? We're going to add another 5,000. Is that good?” They said, “Wow, that's great.” And then, if Jim Acosta goes and says, “Are you happy with the President?” “No, he should have given us 10,000.” That's what's happening. You know why? Because that's a standard political answer. And that's a shame because we have done a job like nobody has ever done a job."
3188,2020-04-05,"But we've just delivered a lot of masks. We've just delivered a lot of gowns and protective gear. But, you know, you're talking about a massive — you're talking about a massive number. But, as of this morning, people were very, very happy."
3189,2020-04-05,Steve?
3190,2020-04-05,"No, they didn't ask for a bailout. No."
3191,2020-04-05,"It was really more of a discussion than asking. We discu- — you know, we did discuss the concept of tariffs because, as you know, this was a dispute among a couple of countries that I think they want to be able to get it solved. They had a dispute. They had a competition. But they want to get it resolved."
3192,2020-04-05,Russia —
3193,2020-04-05,"— and Saudi Arabia, I think want to get it —"
3194,2020-04-05,"Yeah. I think they want to get it resolved. I think they're working very hard. I mean, they told me they want to get it resolved. They're working very hard."
3195,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
3196,2020-04-05,"Well, why don't you ask him?"
3197,2020-04-05,What's that? A “gotcha”? “I gotcha.” You used the word “our.”
3198,2020-04-05,"“Our” — you know, what “our” means? United States of America. That's what it means. It means —"
3199,2020-04-05,Our. Our. It means the United States of America. And then we take that “our” and we distribute it to the states.
3200,2020-04-05,Not that we have to —
3201,2020-04-05,Because we need it for the government and we need it for the federal government.
3202,2020-04-05,"But when the states are in trouble — no, to also keep —"
3203,2020-04-05,"To keep — to keep for our country, because the federal government needs it too, not just the states. But out of that, we oftentimes choose — as an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We're going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says “our,” he's talking about our country. He's talking —"
3204,2020-04-05,Excuse me.
3205,2020-04-05,"He's talking about the federal government. I mean, it's such a basic, simple question, and you try and make it sound so bad."
3206,2020-04-05,You ought to be — you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
3207,2020-04-05,You know what? You ought to be ashamed. It's such a simple question. He said “our.” And “our” means for the country and “our” means for the states —
3208,2020-04-05,— because the states are part of the country. Don't make it sound bad. Don't make it sound bad.
3209,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Steve. Go ahead, back here."
3210,2020-04-05,You just asked your question. You just asked your question in a very nasty tone.
3211,2020-04-05,Let's go.
3212,2020-04-05,Please.
3213,2020-04-05,I gave you a perfect answer. You know it. Go ahead.
3214,2020-04-05,"Sure. But it's also needed for the federal government. We have a federal stockpile and they have state stockpiles. And, frankly, they were — many of the states were totally unprepared for this. So we had to go into the federal stockpile. But we're not an ordering clerk. They have to have for themselves."
3215,2020-04-05,"Now, some of the states were in good shape. Some of the states were not in good shape. That's probably something you could expect. We have been helping states. We have been spending a tremendous amount of time, effort, and billions and billions of dollars on making sure that they have what they have."
3216,2020-04-05,"I mean, take New York: We built them hospitals — I built them four hospitals — built them medical centers, sent a ship with 1,000 rooms and 12 operating rooms, and then on top of that, gave vast numbers of ventilators and vast numbers of surgical gowns, equipment, masks, everything else."
3217,2020-04-05,"Now, they had a chance to order ventilators over the years. They had a chance to order a very big — but they didn't choose to do it. We were there and we helped them. And I think the governor of New York is very thankful for the help that we gave."
3218,2020-04-05,"But we have a stockpile. It's a federal stockpile. We can use that for states, or we can use it for ourselves. We do use it for the federal government. We have a very big federal government."
3219,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
3220,2020-04-05,"Well, we're not a traffic cop. We're a humanitarian cop. We help — it's like the ships. Do you think we wanted to take two big ships into our country that have obvious problems? And you know the problems I'm talking about. So I have a decision to make: Do I take them in or do I save lives? Okay? Do I take them in or do I save? I decided to take them in."
3221,2020-04-05,"And we have tremendous protection. We have great doctors there to help the people. They had four or five people that died. That was as of last night. They died on the ships. We took care of it. And now the people are in the process of — and many are already back in Canada, they're back in the UK — United Kingdom. And many of them were American citizens. Some were very sick. We're taking care of the sick people. We're testing all of the others very, very carefully — very, very carefully. They are being tested like you wouldn't believe. And we solve a humanitarian catastrophe. You know why? Because nobody else would take the ships. Nobody else would take them. So we docked him in, I think, Fort Lauderdale."
3222,2020-04-05,We do say that.
3223,2020-04-05,We do say that.
3224,2020-04-05,We say we're — we say and use the Act.
3225,2020-04-05,"Excuse me, we do say that and we use the Act. And we've used it a number of times very powerfully. And a lot of times, we don't have to use it, because we say, “We're going to use it if you don't do this or that.”"
3226,2020-04-05,"And then we also have companies that act incredibly well. We have plenty of them — mostly them. But we've used the Act very powerfully. And a lot of times, you don't have to exercise the Act; all you have to do is tell them, “Look, if you don't do this, we're going to use the Act.”"
3227,2020-04-05,And we've done a good job with it — maybe a great job.
3228,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3229,2020-04-05,No. Me sign? No. There's millions of checks. I'm going to sign them? No. It's a Trump administration initiative. But do I want to sign them? No.
3230,2020-04-05,"The people are getting — the people are getting their money. There's a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different ways. There's also stimulus going for companies that would — if it weren't our government, would not — and some companies that were very strong a month ago."
3231,2020-04-05,"Again, we had the strongest economy in the world. We had our best ever. We had probably the best economy in the history of the world, bigger than China, bigger than anybody. And one day, we have to say, “Close it up. Stop. Everybody go home.” And you know what? That's pretty tough to do that."
3232,2020-04-05,"I don't know. All I can tell you is the small business today is — we're way ahead of schedule. There is a problem where — and — which I pointed out; I said, “You shouldn't do it this way” — with unemployment, where 40-year-old equipment by the states. We're sending the money to the states. Once the money is sent to the states, then the states, whether they're Republican or Democrat, have to get the money out to the people. Hopefully they'll be able to do it."
3233,2020-04-05,"But many of those states have 40-year-old computers. I don't know that they're equipped. I wanted to give them money direct, if that's what you're talking about. I wanted to give the money out direct. It would have been much easier. But the Democrats and some people, said, “No, let's do it the complicated way.”"
3234,2020-04-05,"All right, well, I was talking about —"
3235,2020-04-05,"Excuse me, I was talking about both."
3236,2020-04-05,"Yeah, they'll get it. They will."
3237,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
3238,2020-04-05,Sure.
3239,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Deborah."
3240,2020-04-05,It is going to go away. It is going away.
3241,2020-04-05,It's going — I didn't say a date.
3242,2020-04-05,I said it's going away and it is going away.
3243,2020-04-05,"Okay, are you —"
3244,2020-04-05,"Okay, that was a good answer to your question. No, no, no. No, no. No more. That was a long, but a very good answer. That was enough for you."
3245,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we're going to do that."
3246,2020-04-05,We'll be talking about that at a different time.
3247,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Go head."
3248,2020-04-05,"Well, that's up to Dr. Birx. You'll decide as to when —"
3249,2020-04-05,"I'm sure they'll talk to you about that, and Dr. Fauci too."
3250,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
3251,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, if you want — go ahead."
3252,2020-04-05,"No, they should've had more ventilators at the time. They should have had more ventilators. They were totally under serviced. We are trying to do — we're doing our best for New York. You know, we have — we have states, we have a lot of states. We have territories too. But we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of, some much more so than others."
3253,2020-04-05,"We've worked very well with the governor. We happen to think that he's well served with ventilators. We're going to find out, but we have other states to take care of. We have a big problem in Louisiana, we have a big problem in Michigan, we have a big problem in seven other really strong hotspots, but we're doing the best we can. I wish they did the original orders three years ago. They would've had all the ventilators they needed. Although even then they wouldn't because if you look at what the original request was from New York, it was far greater than anybody ever heard. And we've — we've supplied a lot. I told you, we supplied some just today to New York, and we supplied some yesterday to New York City."
3254,2020-04-05,"Did you have one in the back? Yeah, please."
3255,2020-04-05,I don't think that was the question (inaudible).
3256,2020-04-05,"No, no, he didn't — he didn't misspeak."
3257,2020-04-05,He used the word “our.” Okay? “Our” — “our” is referring to our country.
3258,2020-04-05,"The states, to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge, are a part of our country. We are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping states all over the country. But we also want to keep some because when that surge comes, when you hit those peaks, we're going to need it. And we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to Louisiana, New York, Detroit, different places. That's all."
3259,2020-04-05,"Oh, of course. We're not using them anywhere else. We're not going to be using them, Jon, anywhere else. But we want the flexibility because, you know, we don't even know when the surge is coming, but it's coming soon and it's going to be big, and some areas won't have it."
3260,2020-04-05,"Some areas will be pleasantly surprised, just like we've been. You look at the chart. States that I thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be — really, they've done a great job. Some states are really troubled, but you don't know. You don't know. We have great flexibility."
3261,2020-04-05,"I would have preferred giving them all out. We'd have nothing. And now when we have a surge, we can't get them back from where we gave them because it's very tough to take it back. So we have tremendous flexibility. And it could be New York. It could be Louisiana. Those are two that are really rough. New Jersey is very rough. And they've done a very good job in New Jersey, but New Jersey is very rough."
3262,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please, in the back."
3263,2020-04-05,The guidelines relative to which — the masks?
3264,2020-04-05,I'm just don't choose to.
3265,2020-04-05,"They're not mandatory guidelines; they're guidelines. They suggest you could wear them. You don't have to wear them. In fact, the Director is here. If you want to say a couple of words about it. You don't — you can, if you want. You don't have to."
3266,2020-04-05,"But basically, it's — it's a voluntary thing. Say it, Director. He's doing a good job."
3267,2020-04-05,And I was just tested also. So I assume I don't know have the virus so I don't have to worry about spreading it. Okay?
3268,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
3269,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3270,2020-04-05,"Well, I can always consider — look, tariffs have made a tremendous amount of money for our country. I put them on China, I put them on other places, and other countries tariff us, and they take advantage of us and they have for many years."
3271,2020-04-05,"Look, countries have taken advantage of the United States for years. They've ripped us off like nobody can even believe, whether it be on — on manufacturing, whether it be on exporting, whether it be on almost anything, including military, where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that, frankly, take advantage of us, don't even like us. Okay?"
3272,2020-04-05,"So this has been going on for years. They tariff us. They create artificial — you could say non-financial barriers, which are worse than financial barriers. You can't sell your product, you can't take care of our farmers, they won't take our — and yet, they'll take us and sell into us, and we won't charge them anything for doing it. Look, they've taken advantage of us for years."
3273,2020-04-05,"Tariffs are a way of evening the score. Tariffs are a way of just neutralizing. They have tariffs on us. And we now can put tariffs on them. Am I using it for oil? It's something we can. No — am I doing it now? No. Am I thinking about imposing it as of this moment? No. But if we're not treated fairly, it's certainly a tool in the toolbox."
3274,2020-04-05,"Well, it would be the same thing. No, it would be the same thing. They are having a dispute — the two countries — and it's hurting the rest of the world because it's really hurting the energy industry. Russia is being hurt unbelievably badly and Saudi Arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly. Because oil and gas is a primary — that's where they get most of their income. And this is a price like from the 1950s, all right? It's a price from the 1950s. They are being hurt very badly. I think they're going to settle their dispute pretty quickly."
3275,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
3276,2020-04-05,"Well, they have increased production. That's what they've done. They've increased it so much that there's so — you meant the opposite."
3277,2020-04-05,I meant — yeah. Why do you think you haven't been successful in (inaudible) increase production?
3278,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Look, look, just so — well, they're going to stop because the market. Ultimately, the market is going to get them to stop. But they both did the opposite. They increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil. Who would have ever thought, right?"
3279,2020-04-05,"You go to — you go to some of these kingdoms, water is far more valuable than oil. There's so much oil. It's a tribute, in a way."
3280,2020-04-05,"But what happened is there was a lot to start off with, and then you had the virus, and it knocked the hell out of the market, it — in terms of demand. So there's no demand and there's tremendous supply."
3281,2020-04-05,"So, I mean, you saw numbers where it was down to 20, and down, frankly, below 20. It was even below 20. It's an incredible thing, the market. But ultimately the marketplace will take care of it. But I think they're going to work out their problem fairly quickly."
3282,2020-04-05,"Okay, go ahead."
3283,2020-04-05,"I'd talk — if it were important to talk to her, I'd talk to her."
3284,2020-04-05,"If it were important for the American people, I'd talk to her. But other than that, I can have other people talking to her."
3285,2020-04-05,"Look, you ready? Infrastructure is a great thing for me. I think infrastructure for this country — we have an old, broken infrastructure. Fifty years ago, we were the envy of the world. And then we spent all this money so stupidly in the Middle East. We spent — it's going to be very close to $8 trillion in the Middle East. How stupid was that decision? But they spent it on that and other things."
3286,2020-04-05,We've got to fix our infrastructure.
3287,2020-04-05,"That means roads, highways, tunnels, airports, everything. We got to fix our infra- —"
3288,2020-04-05,"And the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong as a country, we're borrowing at zero. We never had a chance to borrow at zero. Even in this country, we'd never had a chance to borrow at zero. We're going borrow — this is a great time."
3289,2020-04-05,"So we can fix our infrastructure, and we'll have almost no interest costs. This is the time to do it."
3290,2020-04-05,"Steve, one more question."
3291,2020-04-05,Which trajec- — which one? I have many trajectories for many things.
3292,2020-04-05,"Say — say it. Say it, Steve. What?"
3293,2020-04-05,On what? On what?
3294,2020-04-05,"I'd have to ask Dr. Fauci, and I'd have — have to ask Deborah. Have the models changed?"
3295,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, the models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come away under the models. The professionals did the models. I was never involved in a model, but — at least, this kind of a model. But you know what? Hundreds of thousands of people, they say, are going to die. I want much less than that. I want none, but it's too late for that. But I want very few people, relative to what the models are saying."
3296,2020-04-05,Those are projections. I hope they're wrong. I hope we're going to be under those projections.
3297,2020-04-05,How come you always have two? Why can't you have one?
3298,2020-04-05,"Every time, “I have three questions. I have two questions.” Can you give me one instead? Because we have a couple of other people. Go ahead."
3299,2020-04-05,The general election will happen on November 3rd.
3300,2020-04-05,"In Wisconsin, what happened is I, through social media — media put out a very strong endorsement of a Republican conservative judge who's an excellent, brilliant judge. He's a justice. And I hear what happened is his poll numbers went through the roof. And because of that, I think they delayed the election."
3301,2020-04-05,I don't know. Why didn't he do it before? He was doing right before the election.
3302,2020-04-05,Excuse me. Why didn't he do this two weeks ago? All of a sudden —
3303,2020-04-05,"Excuse me. All of a sudden, an election which is taking place very soon gets delayed. Now, I just endorsed him today and it was a very strong endorsement. His polls — he's gone very high up. And all of a sudden, the governor comes out — the Democrat governor, by the way — comes out and says, “Oh, we're going to move this election.” So, I don't know. I'm sure — I hope you're right. I hope you're right."
3304,2020-04-05,"No, because I think a lot of people cheat with mail-in voting. I think people should vote with ID — voter ID. I think voter ID is very important. And the reason they don't want voter ID is because they intend to cheat."
3305,2020-04-05,"When you get something, when you buy something, you look at your cards and credit cards and different cards — you have your picture on many of them. Not all of them, but on many of them. You should have a picture on your — on your — for voting. It should be called “Voter ID.” They should have that. And it shouldn't be mail-in —"
3306,2020-04-05,"Excuse me. It shouldn't be mail-in voting. It should be: You go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don't send it in the mail where people pick up — all sorts of bad things can happen by the time they signed that, if they sign that — if they signed that by the time it gets in and is tabulated."
3307,2020-04-05,"No, it shouldn't be mailed in. You should vote at the booth. And you should have voter ID, because when you have voter ID, that's the real deal."
3308,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow.
3309,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much everyone. Thank you. Following the release of our reopening guidelines, governors across the country are looking forward to phase one and announcing plans for an economic resurgence; we're going to have a resurgence, too. At a time when millions of American workers and families are struggling with the financial consequences of the virus, it's critical to continue the medical war while reopening the economy in a safe and responsible fashion."
3310,2020-04-05,"During this time, Americans must maintain strict vigilance and continue to practice careful hygiene, social distancing, and the other protective measures that we have outlined and that everybody has become very familiar with."
3311,2020-04-05,"We continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner. For example, recent deaths are down very, very substantially. You can compare that with their peak not so long ago, and you have numbers of 30 percent, 25 percent. In Detroit, as an example, it's down by over 50 percent. Congratulations. And, in New Orleans, where they've done a terrific job, they're down 65 percent."
3312,2020-04-05,"Thirty states have just one case or less per 1,000 people — far fewer cases per capita, as an example, than Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden."
3313,2020-04-05,"My administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful Paycheck Protection Program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs. We hope to have an agreement very soon. And hopefully tomorrow, the Senate is going to be able to vote. A lot of progress has been made on that — tremendous progress. It's a great plan. It's a great plan. It's helped a lot of people. So we hope to have a vote maybe tomorrow in the Senate."
3314,2020-04-05,"And based on the record-low price of oil that you've been seeing — it's at a level that's very interesting to a lot of people — we're filling up our National Petroleum Reserves. Strategic — you know, the Strategic Reserves. And we're looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves. That would top it out. That would be first time in a long time it's been topped out. We'd get it for the right price."
3315,2020-04-05,"We're also pushing for the deal to include an additional $75 billion — our deal; the deal we're talking about — $75 billion for hospitals and other healthcare providers. Many providers and their employees have taken a huge financial hit in recent weeks. And visits, elective procedures, surgeries, et cetera, et cetera, were canceled. We think that they can all get back online. They'll get it done. The hospitals have really been fantastic. The hospitals, they've — they've stepped up to the plate. They've really done a great job. We appreciate it so much."
3316,2020-04-05,"For areas less affected by the virus, we've issued new recommendations about how to safely resume elective treatments. HHS has also distributed the first $30 billion in direct payments to a million healthcare providers across the country. We've also invested $1.4 billion in community health centers to ensure our most vulnerable communities, including many African American and Hispanic American communities, have access to the services and testing that they need."
3317,2020-04-05,"Earlier today, Vice President Pence spoke with governors from all 50 states about our unified effort to defeat the virus. He had a great call. It was a great call — very positive in, I'd say, every way. Prior to the call, we provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their states — many, many labs. We're providing you with the list. We'll show it to you now if you need it. We'll give you the details. But hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able."
3318,2020-04-05,"Some of the governors, like, as an example, the governor from Maryland didn't really understand the list. He didn't understand too much about what was going on. So now I think he'll be able to do that. It's pretty simple. But they have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out. We'll work with him and work with all of the governors."
3319,2020-04-05,"Similar to the situation with ventilators, states need to assess their complete inventory of available capacity. Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand. And it is a complex subject, but some of the governors didn't understand it. The governor, as an example, Pritzker from Illinois did not understand his capacity. Not simply ask the federal government to provide unlimited support — I mean, you have to take the support where you have it, but we are there to stand with the governors and to help the governors, and that's what we're doing. And they have a tremendous capacity that we've already built up. And you'll be seeing that; we're going to be introducing a couple of the folks in a little while to talk about it."
3320,2020-04-05,"I want to draw your attention to Governor Cuomo's remarks during his press conference today. He said: The President is right. The states' testing is up to the states to do, which will implement the test and logistically coordinate the tests. We have about 300 labs in New York and they do it. And they're great labs, actually. And it's my job to coordinate those 300 labs. I think the President is right when he says that the states should lead."
3321,2020-04-05,And the governor is really — they're really getting — they're getting it together in New York. A lot of good things are happening in New York. And I think the governor is going to come in to see us tomorrow. He's coming to the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon. Andrew is going to be coming in with some of his people. So we look forward to that.
3322,2020-04-05,"The — some of the articles that just recently came about — if you remember, I put out a statement today. For a month, it was all “ventilator, ventilator, ventilator.” That's all people could talk about was ventilators. And we did a great job with that. We built a lot of ventilators, to put it mildly. We have so many now that, at some point soon, we're going to be helping Mexico and Italy and other countries. We'll be sending them ventilators, which they desperately need. They were a position — they were not in a position to build them themselves."
3323,2020-04-05,"But we have thousands being built. Every state has had — they have the ventilators. If they don't, we have almost 10,000 in our Federal Reserve — our “stockpile,” as they call it. And we did a great job with the ventilators."
3324,2020-04-05,"Unfortunately, the press doesn't cover it — other than the fair press. But — so then you say, “Gee, I — they need ventilators.” We don't need ventilators. And that's — that's under pressure we did that."
3325,2020-04-05,"Nobody that needed a ventilator in this country didn't get one. And a story that just came out: “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story.” I'm sure you love to see that. That's by Rich Lowry, a respected journalist and person. “How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story” — which, unfortunately, you did."
3326,2020-04-05,"And here's another one that just came out. Kyle Smith. “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn't.” “The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn't” — because we got it fixed. And we're also going to help the states, by the way, stockpile ventilators. So if a thing like this should happen again, they've got them."
3327,2020-04-05,"The stories on testing are all over the place — that we're actually in good shape. I'm going to have the Vice President and others speak to you about that, but we're in very good shape on testing and we're getting better all the time. You're going to see some interesting things."
3328,2020-04-05,"I thought before I went any further though, I'd like to have General Semonite, who has done an incredible job, tell you where we are. You know we're still building beds and hospitals for people that need them. I guess the hospital business generally is getting pretty much closed out now, but we're — we're creating a lot of space for people, just in case. And in some cases, they probably will be using them."
3329,2020-04-05,"But I thought the general — he's been so impressive and done such a great job. I thought, on behalf of the services and on behalf of the federal government, he'd say a few words about what we're doing right now."
3330,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. General.
3331,2020-04-05,Fantastic job. Thank you very much. Anybody have a question for the general while he's here? Anybody? Because I think he's very self-explanatory. He's done an incredible job.
3332,2020-04-05,"Jeff, do you have a question?"
3333,2020-04-05,"You might say, while you're here, we're building — the general is in charge of the wall on the southern border, and we want to build 450 miles of wall, and it's very much under construction. You might give them a little bit of an update: how are we doing with the wall."
3334,2020-04-05,And we're over 160 miles.
3335,2020-04-05,A hundred and sixty-four miles. And we'll have it done sometime pretty early next year. Very exciting.
3336,2020-04-05,"And you might just say one thing: the quality of that wall, in terms of its power for stopping people that shouldn't be coming into our country."
3337,2020-04-05,"Okay? Yeah, please."
3338,2020-04-05,"Okay? So, General, you have a choice: You can stay and watch — watch these wonderful people ask us really nice questions — or you can go back to building beds."
3339,2020-04-05,Go ahead. I had a feeling you were going to say that.
3340,2020-04-05,"Very impressive. That's an impressive job, isn't it? Seriously. That's really great. Thank you very much. He's a terrific gentleman. We have a lot of great people doing that kind of thing that they really have to get recognition for the incredible job they're doing, because I don't think anybody else could do it. Nothing like that. And that's on top of thousands and thousands of hospitals. And, you know, he built — just in New York alone — four hospitals and 2,900 beds, and got them done so quickly. Nobody — nobody saw anything like it."
3341,2020-04-05,"Fortunately, we haven't had to use too many of them, and that's okay. That's probably better news than having to use them all, right? Because a lot of good things are happening in New York and elsewhere."
3342,2020-04-05,"So through the public-private partnerships and deregulation, the federal government has already made immense testing capabilities available, but some states need to take action to fully utilize it. To date, the United States has conducted millions more tests than any other country. You can add them all up and they don't catch us. And our numbers are doubling almost on a — certainly on a monthly basis, but almost on a weekly basis. We're moving very rapidly, far — at a number nobody thought possible."
3343,2020-04-05,"And we'll be doubling our number of daily tests if the governors bring their states fully online through the capability that they have. We have tremendous capability out there already existing. And we explained that to the governor today. Mike and all of the people explained it very strongly to the governors. They — they really get it now, I think."
3344,2020-04-05,"As the experts have explained, this capacity is sufficient to allow states to conduct diagnostic testing to treat patients as well as contact tracing to contain outbreaks and monitoring to pinpoint potential hotspots during phase one."
3345,2020-04-05,"And there are some hotspots, and we have them pinpointed, and they can really cover it very, very nicely when they know exactly where to go and they're being told where to go. And also, these locations where they're going — and some of them are federal; some of the governors didn't realize they were allowed to use federal locations. They are."
3346,2020-04-05,And we have a booklet of the federal locations. We can hold it up. I think you'll show that. Maybe we'll hold it up now.
3347,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Okay, fine. But you see the number — thanks. Thanks. These are all locations where they can go, which is really pretty amazing. This is just one page out of many."
3348,2020-04-05,Look. Look at this. This is — these are all locations. (The President displays a document.)
3349,2020-04-05,That's a lot of locations. And they can all — what is it? Five thousand —
3350,2020-04-05,"So that's — thank you very much. That's more than anybody thought, and it's already there. They have to use it. That's all. They have to use it. Some weren't aware; some were very much aware. Some weren't aware."
3351,2020-04-05,"My administration also continues to support states with our massive operation to deliver masks, gowns, gloves, and other vital supplies. Admiral Polowczyk and his team at FIFA [FEMA] are really — what a job they've done. And Pete, what a job he's done. They're calling on Easter Sunday to make sure everyone is okay. But they're using detailed data about supply chains to track the deployment of 1 billion pieces of protective equipment through private distributors every two weeks. So what we're doing is we're delivering a number that nobody anywhere in the world is delivering."
3352,2020-04-05,"Thank you. Thanks, Admiral."
3353,2020-04-05,"Mike, please. Thank you, Brad."
3354,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Mike. Deborah?"
3355,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. That was great.
3356,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3357,2020-04-05,"Admiral, go ahead on that one, if you'd like."
3358,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, not everybody agrees that we have to do that much testing. We're going maximum. You understand. There's some people that don't want to do that much testing, but we're going maximum. We're going to the outer limits. And I think that's the way, probably, it should be."
3359,2020-04-05,"Jeff, go ahead."
3360,2020-04-05,It went negative.
3361,2020-04-05,"Like interest rates, they go negative."
3362,2020-04-05,"Well, it's for short term. Much of it has to do with short sellers, much of it has to do — if you look a month into the future, I think it's at $25 or $28 a barrel. So a lot of people got caught. They got caught. And there are a lot of people that are not too happy because they got caught."
3363,2020-04-05,"So if you take a look at it, you'll see it's more of a financial thing than an oil situation, but — because you take, I believe, in a month or so — in other words, go a little bit out, it's at $25 and $28 a barrel. So it's largely a financial squeeze, and they did get squeezed."
3364,2020-04-05,"Well, we've already done that, where Saudi Arabia is cutting back, Russia is cutting back, Mexico is cutting back, and the OPEC Plus — they call it OPEC, plus additional states — are cutting back."
3365,2020-04-05,"And you know, the problem is nobody is driving the car anywhere in the world — essentially, 184 nations. Factories are closed and businesses are closed. And so, all of a sudden — we had really a lot of energy to start off with, oil in particular. We had a lot. And then, all of a sudden, they lost 40, 50 percent of their markets. So it just stopped."
3366,2020-04-05,"So it's going to be picking up, and the energy business will be strong. But they cut back. It could be 20 million barrels, but it's, let's say, 15. That was between Russia and Saudi Arabia."
3367,2020-04-05,"But this had to do with the squeeze, and it was a very tough squeeze. A lot of people got —"
3368,2020-04-05,"Well, they got to do more by the market, to be honest. Look, same thing over here. If the market is the way it is, people are going to slow it down or they're going to stop. That's going to be automatic, and that's happening."
3369,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3370,2020-04-05,"If you give me the name of the company and his name, I'll have that checked out, John. I'll do that."
3371,2020-04-05,It's a friend of yours?
3372,2020-04-05,Why did he call you? He called you to say he's a criminal and why did he get a loan? Or what — what's —
3373,2020-04-05,Okay. If you give me the —
3374,2020-04-05,"— name, I'll look into it."
3375,2020-04-05,"I'd like to look into that, okay?"
3376,2020-04-05,"Kaitlan, go ahead."
3377,2020-04-05,Which companies are you talking about? Under what?
3378,2020-04-05,So we have —
3379,2020-04-05,I'll give you an answer to that. I'll give you a legal answer to that when we look it up. But we have tried to take liability away from these companies. We just don't want that because we want the companies to open and to open strong.
3380,2020-04-05,But I'll get you a legal opinion on that.
3381,2020-04-05,"I'll get you — well, that's what I'm saying. I'll get you a legal opinion on it."
3382,2020-04-05,"Nobody has discussed it, no. But we will now."
3383,2020-04-05,Not one. Not one.
3384,2020-04-05,Not at this point.
3385,2020-04-05,"But we're going to look, because they have talked about general liability. So I'll get you a specific answer from the lawyers. Okay?"
3386,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
3387,2020-04-05,"Oh, I'll bet you know the price of oil right now, don't you?"
3388,2020-04-05,I do. I actually do.
3389,2020-04-05,"Of course, nobody has ever heard of negative oil before, but it's for a short term."
3390,2020-04-05,Yes.
3391,2020-04-05,Yes.
3392,2020-04-05,"Well, at the price you're talking about, you don't need funding. They pay you. See? You know? Because right now —"
3393,2020-04-05,"Well, if you can get it. That's true. If you can get it."
3394,2020-04-05,"Well, at a minimum, we'll let —"
3395,2020-04-05,"— people store. So we'll store it. We'll use it as storage and charge for it. But people need storage desperately, and we have massive storage under the petroleum —"
3396,2020-04-05,"It's not a question of requirement. If we could buy it for nothing, we're going to take everything we can get. The only thing I like better than that is where they pay you to take the oil, but that's a short-term squeeze. You understand that. So it's — I don't think you're going to see that."
3397,2020-04-05,"But, no, we'd like to have Congress — this is a great time to buy oil. And we'd like to have Congress approve it so that we could — instead of just storing it for the big — usually the big companies. Because I think we have 75 million gallons right now, capacity. That's a lot. It's — we've been building it up over a period of time, but that's a lot: 75 million barrels."
3398,2020-04-05,"So we're going to get — either ask for permission to buy it, or we'll store it. One way or the other, it will be full."
3399,2020-04-05,"Okay, please."
3400,2020-04-05,"No, go ahead. You — you can finish up. We'll go right to you."
3401,2020-04-05,"Well, we'll look at it. I heard just as I'm walking into the room. We certainly have plenty of oil. So I'll take a look at that. Okay?"
3402,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
3403,2020-04-05,"Well, we don't — we really don't need it. We use it. We go up. And I've used it a lot. But we use it and then sometimes all they have to do is see it coming."
3404,2020-04-05,"Do you want to talk about that, Admiral? Please."
3405,2020-04-05,And we don't want to embarrass people either.
3406,2020-04-05,"Please, Brad. Go ahead."
3407,2020-04-05,"So, Admiral, you meant if the machines were utilized, that would be the number."
3408,2020-04-05,For this?
3409,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Mike."
3410,2020-04-05,"And take a look at that map. The governor of Maryland could've called Mike Pence, could've saved a lot of money. Look at all of the — look at these different places. And that's Maryland, right there. So, could've saved a lot of money, but that's okay."
3411,2020-04-05,"No, I don't think he needed to go to South Korea."
3412,2020-04-05,"I think he needed to get a little knowledge, would've been helpful."
3413,2020-04-05,"Well, I know one thing: I didn't get any. That's for sure. I didn't get any. We'll look at individual things, and some people will have to return it if we think it's inappropriate."
3414,2020-04-05,"Well, it's being done by great professionals. It's being done by banks and, as you know, community banks all over the country. They're — that's what they do. They loan money, and they're supposed to do it according to not only criteria, but according to what we think is right. But if somebody got something that we think is inappropriate, we'll get it back. Okay? Good — good point."
3415,2020-04-05,Please. Go ahead.
3416,2020-04-05,"Well, I think that South Korea — I had a great talk with President Moon. He's a friend of mine. I congratulated — he had a wonderful election victory. I was very happy about that. He was — as you know, just recently."
3417,2020-04-05,"No, we are negotiating for President Moon and for South Korea to help us monetarily, because we — as you know, we have 32,000 soldiers there. That varies from 28- to 32,000 in South Korea. And we think that, before I came aboard, they paid very little, if anything. So we're defending a wonderful nation — a nation that we have great relationships, but we're asking them to pay for a big percentage of what we're doing. It's not fair. So, it's not a question of reduction; it's a question of will they contribute toward the defense of their own nation."
3418,2020-04-05,We're defending nations that are very wealthy. South Korea is a very wealthy nation. They make our television sets. They make ships. They make everything. And I give them great credit.
3419,2020-04-05,"We've been defending them for many, many decades, as you know. Many, many — over eight decades. And I've gone to them in the past. Last year, I went to them and now they're paying a billion dollars a year. And I went to them again, I said, “Look, I'll be back because that's just a fraction.” And again, the relationship is great, but it's just not a fair relationship."
3420,2020-04-05,We renegotiated the trade deal and made it a much more equitable deal than it was in the past. It was a terrible deal. It was done by Hillary Clinton. It was a terrible deal. The new deal is a much more equitable deal — that's on trade.
3421,2020-04-05,"But, on the military, I mean, we're paying for the military for — to defend another nation that's 8,500 miles away. And they're not the only one I'm talking to you, by the way, as you know. I won't go into names, but I've done this. Nobody talks about it, but I think it's appropriate. I think the taxpayer of our country — taxpayers — want to hear these things. And so now they're — they've offered us a certain amount of money, and I have rejected it. I just said, “It's just — look, you know, we're doing a tremendous service.” We have a wonderful feeling and a wonderful relationship with each other, but we have to be treated equitably and fairly. And so that's where it is right now. And what's going to happen, I can't tell you, but we'll find out fairly soon."
3422,2020-04-05,"But I congratulate the President, who is a friend of mine — I congratulate President Moon on having a terrific victory."
3423,2020-04-05,Please. Yeah.
3424,2020-04-05,Sure.
3425,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to be talking about that in phase four, as you know, which will start very shortly. And that has to do with infrastructure — hopefully infrastructure, because this country needs infrastructure."
3426,2020-04-05,"We spend all this money in the Middle East — $8 trillion. Eight trillion — trillion, with a “T” — dollars in the Middle East, but if you have a pothole in a highway someplace, they don't want you to spend the money to fix it. How stupid have we been in this country? How stupid have we been? And that's changing rapidly — you know that; you've seen that — including things like negotiating with friends."
3427,2020-04-05,"But when we are helping friends, friends should reimburse us for the cost. I mean, why should we be defending nations for free? We're defending a nation for free. Now I'm getting a billion dollars a year, and we're — we'll be getting — we were offered much more than that, but I turned it down. So that's where we are with that."
3428,2020-04-05,"As far as — as far as the other is concerned, look, we have to be smart in this country. We've been taken to the cleaner by every — and I mean with allies, not just with the enemies — with allies. We've been to — frankly, the allies have taken us much more so than the enemies. The enemies we don't do business with, right? The allies, we do business with."
3429,2020-04-05,"And whoever made these deals, whoever made these contracts — in many cases, we didn't have a contract. Like, we didn't have a contract — we didn't have a trade deal with China. They came in and they took $500 billion a year for many years. But anywhere from $200- to $550 billion dollars a year out of our hides."
3430,2020-04-05,"Now we made this great trade deal. Unfortunately, that was a number of months ago. And it's a great deal. They're paying 25 percent on $250 billion. They're — a lot of things are happening. They're going to have to purchase $250 billion worth of goods, including farm product — up to $50 billion."
3431,2020-04-05,"So, a lot of good things are happening, but then what happened with China was the plague hit us, right? The plague. That was after. This was long after we signed the deal. The plague hit us, so I'm not happy about that."
3432,2020-04-05,"Okay. John, please."
3433,2020-04-05,"John, what a good question that was. Where did that come from?"
3434,2020-04-05,"No, that's very impressive."
3435,2020-04-05,"You know, when Senator Schumer wrote a letter a couple of months ago, and he said, “You should use admirals and generals.” I said, “Well, that's where we've...” First of all, we have our Vice President, who has been incredible, but we have the admirals, we have the generals. And I was just talking to the admiral inside, just before we came out. I said, “Did you go to Annapolis?” He said, “No sir.” I said, “Oh, that's too bad. That's too bad. Where did you go?” He said, “I went to Harvard.” “Oh, that's okay too, I guess.” Right?"
3436,2020-04-05,"So he went to Harvard and he was a great student at Harvard, and he's doing a fantastic job. And this young gentleman was very, very successful. But he wanted to help the country. He wanted to come into the country, and we appreciate it very much. He was a big success — a big, big success."
3437,2020-04-05,"Let's do here, and there next. Okay? We're all set. Good. Go ahead."
3438,2020-04-05,"I don't know. He wanted to, and —"
3439,2020-04-05,"We, believe it or not, have — we get along. Okay? He was very generous yesterday, in particular. Said we did a, quote, “phenomenal” deal. I don't know if anybody wrote that, but he said that, and I appreciated it. Because it's not about me; it's about these people and thousands behind Mike and the admiral and all of the other people that are working with us."
3440,2020-04-05,"I mean — and you see it. Look, I don't understand when — when I see polling and approval ratings for the job. I mean, this group should get a 95. It really should. And we're really helping the governors a lot. And the governors call me — the ones I know, or the Republicans, but the ones I know — and they say, “It's incredible, the job you're doing.” Again, not me — the job this group is doing."
3441,2020-04-05,"And you sit here — I just — I'm watching from — from the corner, and I'm just saying, “Boy, it's incredible stuff.” When you watch the general get up — General Semonite — and talk about — boom, boom, boom. You don't see that. You don't see that. When you hear the admiral speak about the testing — how good it is — and yet people don't like to say it."
3442,2020-04-05,"But remember, it was all about ventilators a month ago. Ventilators, ventilat- — then we fixed it. You don't hear about ventilators. Where is the ventilator — Jeff, you haven't asked about ventilators recently. What's going on? What about ventilators? We're helping other countries now, because they can't have — they're very hard to come by, and they take a long time to make — like, years. It's incredible, the job they've done — that our people have done and also private companies have done."
3443,2020-04-05,"You know, you talk about the act. We — we don't like to use it unless we have to. Because, a lot of times, just the fact that you have it gets you everything you need. So, you know, we don't want to embarrass any of the companies. But we have used it on a number of occasions and it worked. But it works just as well before you have to use it, because they don't want to be embarrassed, and I don't want to embarrass them because they've done a great job."
3444,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
3445,2020-04-05,"No, I think, right behind you. I promised. I can't — I cannot tell a lie. So, I mean, we'll get you next. Okay?"
3446,2020-04-05,We'll get you next.
3447,2020-04-05,"No, no. You."
3448,2020-04-05,"Well, it's not bipartisan. It's mostly partisan. But more importantly than mostly partisan, it's incorrect. You have — you have the experts. Look at these maps. I mean, you have the maps with so many different locations."
3449,2020-04-05,"In the case of, as an example, Governor Hogan. He didn't really know. He really — it was very obvious to any of those listening on the call today — even though you weren't supposed to be on it, I'm sure that some of you were or representatives were. He really didn't know about the federal laboratories. Would you say that's correct, Mike? He didn't know."
3450,2020-04-05,"He didn't know. And Mike doesn't like to get into this stuff. He's less controversial than I am. But he didn't know about it. And if he did know about it, he would've been happy."
3451,2020-04-05,"No, we've done a really good job on testing. Now, with that being said, we have tests coming out perhaps over the next two weeks that will blow the whole industry away. Now, a lot of people love the Abbott test. So do I. You know, the Abbott test is great because it's, boom, it's — they touch, they put it in, and in five minutes you have — the problem is that doesn't do massive numbers like the big machine. But the big machine takes a day, takes a day and a half, you know, with delivery and everything else."
3452,2020-04-05,"But we have tremendous testing — tremendous testing capability. Remember this: We've tested more than any country in the world by far. In fact, I think I read where if you add up every other country in the world, we've tested more."
3453,2020-04-05,"But remember this: We're dealing in politics, we're dealing with a thing called — November 3rd of this year. Do you know what November 3rd represents, right? You know better than anybody in the room. November 3rd of this year — it's called the presidential election. No matter what I do, no matter where we go, no matter how well we do, no matter what, if I came up with a tablet, you take it and this plague is gone, they'll say, “Trump did a terrible job. Terrible. Terrible.” Because that's their soundbite. That's the political soundbite."
3454,2020-04-05,"They know the great job we've done. But with all of that being said and — and also, there is a thing that somebody could talk to if they want, but I don't want to bore you with it. Not everybody believes we should do so much testing. You don't need so much. We're talking about maximum. Maximum."
3455,2020-04-05,"The reason that the Democrats — and some others, maybe, because they don't know — they want maximum because they want to be able to criticize. Because it's almost impossible to get to the maximum number, and yet we've been able to do it already."
3456,2020-04-05,"But with that — and you'll be seeing this over the next — I think over the next couple of weeks or sooner. We have a test — if it comes out, it'll revolutionize the whole world of testing. It'll be — it'll be something really special."
3457,2020-04-05,"So I don't view it as personal at all. What I do say is, it's something that's not fair to thousands of people that have done such a good job."
3458,2020-04-05,"Well, I know. I understand."
3459,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3460,2020-04-05,"And a lot of people love Trump, right? A lot of people love me. You see them all the time, right? I guess I'm here for a reason, you know? To the best of my knowledge, I won. And I think we're going to win again. I think we're going to win in a landslide."
3461,2020-04-05,"But just so you understand, you're talking about March, right?"
3462,2020-04-05,"And yet — excuse me. Excuse me,"
3463,2020-04-05,"I know. I understand. And yet, in January, a certain date — you know the date better than I do — we put on a ban of China, where China can't come in. And before March, we put on a ban on Europe, where Europe can't come in. So how could you say I wasn't taking it seriously?"
3464,2020-04-05,"You know, I put on a ban on China before anybody in this country died. I put on a ban. And so you tell me. Nancy Pelosi was having — she wanted to have a street party in Chinatown in San Francisco at the end of February. That's a month later. And then they tell me it's only a political talking point. But you feed into it, because you're too good a reporter to let that happen. Really, you are a good reporter. You're too good a reporter to let that happen."
3465,2020-04-05,"Remember this: So at the end of January, I put on a ban. People that were in that room will tell you — I think there were 21 people — I was the only one in the whole room that wanted to do it. Fortunately, I was the one that counted for that purpose. We put on a ban because I was reading bad things about China. World Health Organization should have told us, but I was reading it, with or without them. They should have known. All they had to do is read it. They didn't have to even be there. But they tried to cover up for China — World Health covered up for China."
3466,2020-04-05,"But — no, no. Wait. But you can't say this. Look, I put on a ban. In other words, I stopped China from coming to the United States. I stopped Europe from coming into the United States, long before the March date that you're talking about. So people should say I acted very early. That was a very hard thing to do. Doing that was a very hard thing. I didn't want to do that."
3467,2020-04-05,"But I did it because I thought — and Dr. Fauci said that, by doing it, President Trump saved tens of thousands of lives. So I did take it very seriously."
3468,2020-04-05,"Oh, I don't know — I don't know about rallies. I really don't know about rallies."
3469,2020-04-05,"I know one thing: I haven't left the White House in months, except for a brief moment to give a wonderful ship, the Comfort —"
3470,2020-04-05,"I don't know. Did I hold a rally? I'm sorry I hold a rally. Did I hold a rally? Let me tell you, in January, when I did this, you had virtually no cases and no deaths, and yet I put it on. So how could I not?"
3471,2020-04-05,"Why was Nancy Pelosi — right? — Nancy Pelosi is holding a street fair. She wants a street fair in San Francisco, in Chinatown, to prove — you know what the purpose of it was — to prove that there's no problem. Many other politicians did the same thing. They wanted to prove —"
3472,2020-04-05,"While I was — no, of course not. No, no, no. I've been — people are amazed at how early I acted, and I did act early. With that being said, it's very hard to say, “Let's close down the greatest economy in the history of the world.” I had it closed down. I, and everybody else that works with me, and 300 and — close to 350 million people built the greatest economy in the history of the world: best employment numbers, best stock market numbers, best numbers in virtually every category. Even good manufacturing numbers. The previous administration said manufacturing was dead for our country. Even great manufacturing numbers."
3473,2020-04-05,"And you know what? I did that, and somebody walked into my office and said, “Sir, you're going to have to close down the economy. You're going to have to close the country.” But you know what I say to you? We're going to rebuild it. And we're going to rebuild it better, and it's going to go faster than people think. I built it once; I'll built it a second time."
3474,2020-04-05,Please.
3475,2020-04-05,Please. Go ahead.
3476,2020-04-05,"I think it's a great question, because there is bipartisanship. Look, we're getting the Paycheck Plan. It's — already $350 billion was approved, essentially unanimously. And we have another 250, which I think you're going to find out is going to be a higher number than that. Okay? I won't say it now, because I don't know if they've released it or not, but it's going to end up being more than $250 billion. And this is going to small businesses and it's going to workers."
3477,2020-04-05,And these are really bipartisan plans. It's a great thing that's happening. So I think the fact that we're able to do all of this in a bipartisan way is great.
3478,2020-04-05,"Now, the tax cuts that the Republicans did, we had no help from the Democrats, so you can't say that's bipartisan. But this whole thing, getting our country back — and, you know, Nancy Pelosi has been — she's very nasty. She, you know, wasted a lot of time with the impeachment hoax. It was a total hoax. It went nowhere. But — and that was not good. And Schumer, I guess, did the same thing, but he sort of accepted it. He just did what he was supposed to do, and he didn't do very well with it. But, you know, that was not appropriate. That was a bad thing for our country. But it was fine. I mean, I understand the game."
3479,2020-04-05,"They have a little bit of a majority. So they say, “Let's do something and let's try and stir it up.” But they wasted a year. They wasted tremendous — we could've been doing things that would have been great for our country. They could have been looking into China. They should have been looking into China, as an example. A lot of people are blaming the Democrats for wasting all that time, because it was during that period of time, as you know, that it was fomenting."
3480,2020-04-05,"But I think we've had a great spirit of bipartisanship, in a certain way. It's not — I wouldn't say we're going to set records throughout the world, but things are happening that are very good. The country is coming together. And I'll tell you what: The people are coming together. The people are really coming together. I think you're going to find that our country is much more unified."
3481,2020-04-05,"I do think that the press, the media, foments a lot of this — a lot of anger. I really believe it. It foments tremendous anger. For instance, I'll be asked a tremendously hostile question from somebody, and then I'll answer to — in a hostile way, which is appropriate; otherwise, you look foolish. Otherwise, it looks like just walk off the stage and bow your head. I can't do that. You know, I just can't do that."
3482,2020-04-05,"But a lot of these questions that are asked from certain networks are so hostile, and there's no reason for it. There's no reason for it. We are in a war. This is a World War Two, this is a World War One — where, by the way, the war essentially ended because of a plague. That was one of the worst ever. They lost almost 100 million people. But we're in a big war."
3483,2020-04-05,"And I'll say one thing about — because I think it's important. The last person — I did it early, but I was the last person that wanted to close down one of the great economic — you can't call it an experiment, but everything, I guess, in life is an experiment. So I say experiments. But one of the great economic stories in history. I'm the last person who wanted to do it."
3484,2020-04-05,"But we did the right thing, because if we didn't do it, you would have had a million people, a million and a half people, maybe 2 million people dead. Now, we're going toward 50, I'm hearing, or 60,000 people. One is too many. I always say it: One is too many. But we're going toward 50- or 60,000 people. That's at the lower — as you know, the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people. We — we could end up at 50 to 60. Okay? It's horrible. If we didn't do what we did, we would have had, I think, a million people, maybe 2 million people, maybe more than that."
3485,2020-04-05,"And you look — there's one country in particular that decided, “Let's wing it. Let's just keep going.” They are being inundated with death. Now, if you take a look at some of the hospitals where — one of them I knew growing up in Queens, and I'm looking at the bodies laying in hallways, being brought into refrigerated trucks. The trucks — these massive trucks, bodies going in. Multiply that times 10. It's not sustainable."
3486,2020-04-05,"And many of the people that have this theory, “Oh, let's — you know, maybe we could have just gone right through it,” I was — I was somebody that would have loved to have done that, but it wouldn't have been sustainable. You can't lose a million people. That's more than — that's almost double what we lost in the Civil War. I use that as a guide. Civil War: 600,000 people died. So it's not sustainable. But it could have been much more than a million people."
3487,2020-04-05,"I mean, if you took a number and cut it half, and half, and in half again, you'd end up at 500,000 people — okay? — if you want to make a very conservative guesstimate. Five hundred thousand people is not acceptable. Is that a correct sort of an analogy?"
3488,2020-04-05,"So, I mean, I see it all the time by friends of mine, by people that I have great respect for: “Well, we could have done this. We could have done...” And remember this: When we say 50 and they compare 50 to the 35 of the flu — because it averaged 35, 36,000 over a 10-year period. It's a lot. Who would think that? But we're not talking about with the flu. That's just — it just goes. We're not locking ourselves in our units. We're not locking ourselves in our apartments and not moving and not touching anybody, and just saying — you know, the world. In this case, we are. And we're still going to lose between 50 and 60."
3489,2020-04-05,"But if we just kept it going on a normal basis, which is really the only standard that you can compare it to with the flu, because that was a normal basis. You get into an airplane, you travel to Florida, you go to Texas. You go wherever you're going."
3490,2020-04-05,"But, in this case, if we didn't do anything, the number wouldn't be 50 to 60,000. The number would be a million people dead. It would be a million-five, a million-two. Maybe 700,000. It would have been a number in — like that."
3491,2020-04-05,"Because — because — and it's so important because I see so much: “Oh, well, you know, they can...” You can't compare it, because I'll tell you what: The people of this country, what they've done — they've gone out of their way — what they — the way they've lived, it hasn't — it's not — it's not great. It's terrible. Maybe the first three days, and then all of a sudden — you see what's going on; they want to get going. And I get that fully."
3492,2020-04-05,"But I just say this: If we would have done that, we would have lost anywhere from a million to more than 2 million people. Now, with all of the death that we've seen — and 50- or 60,000 people, heading toward — right now it's at 40. But 50- or 60,000 people; probably over 50, from what I see. But that's with our guard up. If we took our guard down and just said, “Okay, we're just going to keep this open,” we would have lost millions of people. Can you imagine?"
3493,2020-04-05,"Look how bad it looks now, when you look at the bodies. When you look at Hart Island in New York, where they have the mass grave, and all of the things that you see. Can you imagine if we had the guard down, if we didn't do anything and we just said, “Let's ride it out”? It would not have been sustainable in any way. It would have been an atrocity."
3494,2020-04-05,"So we've done the right thing. We've really done the right thing. And the people that have worked so hard — and dangerously. I'll tell you — again, I say it, but I watch those doctors and nurses and medical people running into those hospitals, and they don't even have their gear on. Forget about gear, whether it's great gear or not. And we're bringing in the best gear in the world. But they're running in with open everything, and they're pushing. I mean, the job — they're like warriors, the job they're doing."
3495,2020-04-05,"But if we didn't do the moves that we made, you would have had a million, a million and a half, 2 million people dead. So multiply that times 50; you're talking about — you would have had 10 to 20 to 25 times more people dead than all of the people that we've been watching. That's not acceptable. The 50,000 is not acceptable. It's so horrible. But can you imagine multiplying that out by 20 or more? It's not acceptable."
3496,2020-04-05,So it's a very good question. I appreciate it. We'll see you tomorrow. We'll see you tomorrow.
3497,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. So, nice to be with you. America continues to gain ground in the war against the virus."
3498,2020-04-05,"I want to thank the American people for answering the call, following our guidelines, and making the sacrifices required to overcome this terrible threat. More aggressively we commit to social distancing — so important. Social distancing — such an important phrase. And we do it right now. The more lives we can save and the sooner we can eventually get people back to work, back to school, and back to normal."
3499,2020-04-05,"And there are large sections of our country — probably can go back much sooner than other sections. And we're obviously looking at that also. People are asking, “Is that an alternative?” And I say, “Absolutely, it is an alternative.”"
3500,2020-04-05,"I have now approved major disaster declarations for New York, California, Washington, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. That has great significance, as you know, and legal significance."
3501,2020-04-05,"We're in a constant grouping, and I can say this: We have a large grouping of people that does nothing but communicate with the various officials, including we've been spending a lot of time with New York officials because that really is, by far, the hottest spot. They've got a number of very tough weeks ahead of them."
3502,2020-04-05,"The governor is doing a very good job. I spoke to the governor — Governor Cuomo — last night and this morning, and he mentioned that, in his remarks, that he's using the — that we are using — and I think he feels, because he understands negotiation — he thinks we're using very appropriately the Defense Production Act. And we are. We're using it where needed. It's a great point of leverage; it's a great negotiating tool."
3503,2020-04-05,"But I've really — I will tell you, there's tremendous spirit from people and tremendous spirit with respect to these companies. And I don't have to use it very much at all. They want to do it. As you know, General Motors is involved; Ford is involved; 3M is involved; others are involved. And they're all working very hard to produce product — different — all different products."
3504,2020-04-05,"We had very little product when we came. We built it up, and we've — we give it away as fast as we can to the different states. We're also, as you know, building numerous hospitals and medical centers throughout certain areas in New York. It's at the convention center, the Javits Convention Center. We're doing four hospitals and we're doing, throughout the state, four medical centers. They're somewhat different."
3505,2020-04-05,"I want you to know that I'm doing everything in my power to help the city pull through this challenge. I'm working very hard on New York. It's really, by far, our biggest problem. Maybe it will be; maybe it won't be. But there's a lot of good, capable people working on it with us, and our teams are working very well with the state representatives."
3506,2020-04-05,"We're also doing some very large testings throughout the country. I told you yesterday that, in South Korea — and this is not a knock in any way because I just spoke with President Moon; we had a very good conversation about numerous other things — but they've done a very good job on testing, but we now are doing more testing that anybody, by far. We do more in eight days than they do in eight weeks. And we go up, on a daily basis, exponentially. So, it's really good."
3507,2020-04-05,"By the way, while I'm on it, I also spoke with Prime Minister Abe of Japan last night, and I congratulated him on a wise choice. I think it's going to be a fantastic Olympics — 2021. I think it's going to be a fantastic Olympics. It was the absolute right decision to delay it for a full year and now have a full, beautiful Olympics. It's going to be very important because it's probably the first time, maybe ever, or certainly in a long time, that it was on a odd year. It always on an even year, they tell me. But he's going to have a fantastic success, and now they'll have even more time. He didn't need any more time. Everything was perfectly ready. What a job they've done."
3508,2020-04-05,"But Japan — I want to congratulate Japan, the IOC, and Prime Minister Abe on a great decision. I think it's going to be a fantastic Olympics. I told him I'll be there. I'll be there."
3509,2020-04-05,"As we fight to protect American lives, we're also protecting American livelihoods. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are very close to passing an emergency relief bill for American workers, families, and businesses. This legislation, in addition to the two bills I signed this month that includes, as you know, sick leave, and we have all sorts of things in for the workers, for families."
3510,2020-04-05,"But we have a tremendous paid sick leave provision for workers at no cost at all to the employers. And that's a big thing: no cost to the employers. We want to get everybody back, working."
3511,2020-04-05,"Together, this $2.2 trillion legislative package is bigger than anything, I believe, ever passed in Congress. Perhaps, relatively speaking, if you go back — look during the FDR New Deal days — there was something that if you time-value it, you could say it was bigger. I don't know. But this is certainly, in terms of dollars, by far and away the biggest ever, ever done. And that's a tremendous thing because a lot of this money goes to jobs, jobs, jobs, and families, families, families."
3512,2020-04-05,"The Senate bill, as you know, includes:"
3513,2020-04-05,"$350 billion in job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying their workers. They continue paying their workers. That's what we want: We want them to keep their workers and pay their workers. This will help businesses keep workers in the payroll and allow our economy to quickly accelerate as soon as we defeat the virus. $350 billion in direct cash payments will be available for every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year. That would be $3,400, very quickly, for the typical family of four. Nothing like that has ever been done in our country. Up to $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. The average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100 percent of their salary for up to four full months. Unlike normal unemployment benefits, independent contractors and the self-employed will be eligible. So you have independent contractors and self-employed people will be eligible for this. Over $100 billion to support the heroic work of our doctors, nurses, and hospitals. They've been incredible. $45 billion for Disaster Relief Fund. So we are setting up a fund of $45 billion for disaster relief. That's more than doubling the amount available to support my national emergency and disaster declarations. It's a doubling up. $27 billion to build up the Strategic National Stockpile with critical supplies, including masks, respirators, pharmaceuticals, and everything you can imagine — because it was very depleted, like our military was depleted. Now we have a brand-new military. Never had a military like this. We have equipment either coming or it's already come. For the most part, it's already come. But we have a lot of things that will soon be coming — planes, missiles, rockets, lots of things. But the stockpile was very depleted, like everything else. This will also include significant funding for the development of vaccines on top of the $8 billion we approved several weeks ago. Over $500 billion in support for the hardest-hit industries, with a ban on corporate stock buybacks, which is something I insisted on, and frankly, I tell you, the Republicans wanted that and the Democrats wanted that. We want them to use the money for the companies and the planes, or whatever they may be helping to get over this rough patch. And I don't think it's going to end up being such a rough patch. I think it's going to, when we open — especially, if we can open it — the sooner, the better — it's going to open up like a rocket ship. I think it's going to go very good and very quickly."
3514,2020-04-05,"And you're going to have some tough new limits on executive compensation also. They need the money. They're going to have to, sort of, just make things work, because we're interested in the workers, the jobs. And we're interested in the companies because that's really what fuels the workers in those great jobs. And we also have $16 billion in funding for the purchase of personal protective equipment — you know about that — such as masks and respirators through the Strategic National Stockpile."
3515,2020-04-05,"I encourage the House to pass this vital legislation and send the bill to my desk for signature. Without delay, I will sign it immediately. We will have a signing, and it'll be a great signing and a great day for the American worker and for American families and, frankly, for American companies, some of which were having the best years they've ever had these last few years. And then, a little bit less than a month ago, they went into a position that they haven't seen because of the hidden enemy, the virus."
3516,2020-04-05,"Earlier today, I spoke to leaders of many of America's amazing nonprofit organizations. I thanked them for their unwaving [sic] and unwavering devotion to American people, to American families, to our nation. And they have been fantastic. They've been collecting supplies, distributing food, supporting healthcare workers, caring for vulnerable workers and families. I encourage them to continue to do it. But I'll tell you, the nonprofits have been fantastic; they've been great. They're great people, actually. I know a lot of them."
3517,2020-04-05,"Finally, I want to provide a brief update on the critical supplies. Through FEMA, the federal government has delivered, or is in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators — think of that: 9.4 million — 20 million surgical masks, and we have others that we think are going to be delivered pretty quickly. The whole world — you know, it's not just us; it's not just the States. The whole world is trying to get these things — in competition with many, many countries."
3518,2020-04-05,"I believe today you broke the 150 mark for the virus. We have 150 countries — over 150 countries where you have this virus. And nobody would ever believe a thing like that's possible. Nobody could have ever seen something like this coming, but now we know, and we know it can happen and happen again. And if it does, somebody is going to be very well prepared because of what we've learned and how we've done. It's been incredible, how we've done."
3519,2020-04-05,"Remember this: More tests than anybody, by far. And the news, the reporters, the media always likes to bring South Korea — they called me and they told me, “It's amazing. Your testing procedures are amazing.” Plus, we have a test that's a very high-level test, and it's a test that's very accurate."
3520,2020-04-05,"3.1 million face shields, 2.6 million surgical gowns, 14.6 million gloves, and almost 6,000 ventilators, which go to the areas of greatest needs. We sent, over the last day, 4,000 ventilators to New York. And I spoke with the governor about that; he was happy. I spoke with the mayor also about that. Mayor de Blasio, he was very happy. It's hard not to be happy with the job we're doing — that, I can tell you."
3521,2020-04-05,"Throughout this national emergency, everyday heroes continue to step forward and demonstrate the extraordinary character of our nation, including the people behind me. By the way, these people are amazing. They are amazing people and they become — I don't know, maybe I should just speak for myself, but to me, they've become friends. Maybe they don't like me. Maybe they don't; maybe they do. I don't know. All I can tell you is they're talented people. They work very hard."
3522,2020-04-05,"In Maryland, a 7-year-old boy used his own birthday money to buy meals for dozens of senior citizens. In Nevada, a college student recruited 90 of her friends to help deliver groceries and supplies to the most vulnerable. This is happening all over the country. Thousands and thousands of instances. I could stand up here all day and tell you about other things. In Minnesota, hundreds of medical students have volunteered to provide childcare for hospital workers, helping to keep our doctors and nurses on the frontlines, fighting to save lives."
3523,2020-04-05,These inspiring Americans remind us that we all have a role to play in winning this great national battle. And it's really a worldwide battle. We're dealing with other nations all the time. The people here are — and I am a little bit — I take calls from a lot of people; they're in trouble. A lot of countries are in big trouble.
3524,2020-04-05,"So now we will hear from our great Secretary of the Treasury. He has been working rather hard, I will tell you. Steve Mnuchin is a — he's a fantastic guy and he loves our country, and he's been dealing with both sides — Republican and Democrat. He, sort of, lived over in that beautiful building. It's a very beautiful building. To me, one of the most beautiful buildings, actually, in the world. And he's gotten to know it, Steve, very well."
3525,2020-04-05,"So if we could have a little update, Steve, it would be fantastic, as to how we're doing and what it's looking like."
3526,2020-04-05,Thank you.
3527,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, Steve. Great job."
3528,2020-04-05,"Day and night, right?"
3529,2020-04-05,"Day and night. We was — that was — that was a lot of work. And we'll see how it all goes. We still need a vote, Steve, don't we? Huh?"
3530,2020-04-05,Do you have a question? Yes.
3531,2020-04-05,"Hopefully a long time. We'll see. If we have to go back, we have to go back. We're going to take care of the American worker. We're going to take care of these companies that fuel this country and make the country great. It's not their fault. It's not their fault. But we think —"
3532,2020-04-05,"And don't forget, a lot of this is going to be — to keep companies that are very strong — AAA-rated companies, previously — to keep them going. And it's going to be in the form of loans, so the money is going to come back. This money has — a lot of this money is coming back."
3533,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3534,2020-04-05,"Well, I've been saying that for a long time."
3535,2020-04-05,"Well, we're reliant on many countries where we give up our supply chains, we give up our factories, we give up our production facilities, and we can buy it someplace else for a little bit lower price. But it's really costing us more when that happens, because we lose jobs, we lose everything, and we lose our independence. And we can't let that happen. So we'll be making some changes. We have been making those changes."
3536,2020-04-05,"I don't know that we'll need that, but I think it's happening by itself. I think a lot of things are happening. Well, some people — we make the best medical equipment in the world, and you have some people like the European Union, they don't take it, because they have specifications that don't allow our equipment in because it's designed in a different way. Even though it's a better way, it's designed."
3537,2020-04-05,"They're all — they're all playing games against us, okay? They've been playing games against us for years, and no President has ever done anything about it."
3538,2020-04-05,"But the European Union — if you look at medical equipment, we make the best medical equipment in the world, but we can't sell it because — or not appropriately. And yet, we take their medical equipment in our country. We're changing things, Steve. All of this is changing. But they have specifications so that our equipment — designed specifically so that our equipment can't come into their countries. It's a very terrible thing that's happened to our country."
3539,2020-04-05,"And, let me tell you, some of the people that took the biggest advantage of us: our allies. You know, we talk about allies. They took advantage of us in many ways, but financially as well as even militarily when you look at —"
3540,2020-04-05,"Look, I got — if you look at NATO, the abuse that was given to our country on NATO, where they wouldn't pay, and we were paying for everybody. We were paying — now, because of me, they're paying a lot. Now they've paid a 125, 135 million — billion dollars more. And then, ultimately, Secretary General Stoltenberg — who, I think, you would say is maybe my biggest fan — we got them to pay an additional $400 billion — billion — other countries."
3541,2020-04-05,"And — but — but you know that. And then there's the trade. They make it — they make it almost impossible for us to have a fair deal. They know this. They know I'm just waiting. We have all the advantages, by the way. It's going to be easy when I decide to do it. But this isn't the right time to do it. But we've been treated very, very unfairly by the European Union."
3542,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
3543,2020-04-05,"Well, I know the issue very well. We talked about it just a little while ago. I'll let — Steve, I'm going to let you maybe discuss that."
3544,2020-04-05,"The one — the one good thing, when you think about that, people are going to get, actually, more money. But we don't want to give a disincentive. But they have been talking about that. That's a good question, actually."
3545,2020-04-05,Yes ma'am. Please.
3546,2020-04-05,So —
3547,2020-04-05,"Yeah. You know, I've been very much involved in that. And he was a great gentleman, and a great family."
3548,2020-04-05,"It's just — I mean, I have to say this — and they've been making this statement to the family, I believe: But it's not looking good. He wasn't well for years anyway, in Iran. It's not looking promising. We've gotten so many people back. We got two people back this week."
3549,2020-04-05,"But Robert Levinson, who was outstanding, he was — he's been sick for a long time. And he had some rough problems prior to his detainment or capture. And we feel terribly for the family."
3550,2020-04-05,"No, I don't accept that he's dead. I don't accept it. I mean, I'm telling you it's not — it's not looking great, but I won't accept that he's dead. They haven't told us that he's dead, but a lot of people are thinking that that is the case. I feel badly about it."
3551,2020-04-05,What do you mean by my election success? No.
3552,2020-04-05,"No, no. I think the media — yeah. No, the media would like to see me do poorly in the election. And I think — I think —"
3553,2020-04-05,"Just so you understand — are you ready? I think there are certain people that would like it not to open so quickly. I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls. And I don't know if that's so, but I do think it's so that a lot of — that there are people in your profession that would like that to happen."
3554,2020-04-05,"I think it's very clear — I think it's very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news. You do. She does. There are people in your profession that write fake news. They would love to see me, for whatever reason — because we've done one hell of a job. Nobody has done the job that we've done. And it's lucky that you have this group here, right now, for this problem, or you wouldn't even have a country left."
3555,2020-04-05,"Okay. Go ahead, in the back, please."
3556,2020-04-05,Who are you with? Who are you with?
3557,2020-04-05,Okay.
3558,2020-04-05,"I think that's pretty much, huh?"
3559,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I don't know that that subject is going to come up. There is a lot of talk that that's how this all happened. It came out of China. And they say that's how it happened in China. So it's something, maybe, will be talked about, but it's not the top of my list."
3560,2020-04-05,I think we'll have a very — I think we're going to have very good conference tomorrow.
3561,2020-04-05,"No, but I — we have tested more than anybody. I saw it."
3562,2020-04-05,"Yeah. How many? None. Okay? How many deaths are acceptable to me? None. Okay? None, if that's your question. Look, I saw him. I saw his statement. We have tested, by far, more than anybody. We're testing more than anybody right now. There's nobody even close. And our tests are the best tests. They're the most accurate tests."
3563,2020-04-05,"But if you're saying we're going to test 350 million people — I watched his statement; I disagree with it. We can go to certain states — I could name them now, but I'm not going to do that — but we can go to certain states right now. They have virtually no problem or a very small problem."
3564,2020-04-05,"We don't have to test the entire state in the Middle West or wherever they may be. We don't have to test the entire state. I think it's ridiculous. We don't have to do it. A lot of those states could go back right now, and they probably will. Because at some point in the not-too-distant future, certain states are going to come off the rolls. Maybe New York can't and maybe California can't. Maybe the State of Washington can't, although if you look at them, their biggest problem was in one nursing home."
3565,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead."
3566,2020-04-05,"Well, you know, you're going to just look at that. But if you take a look at the states and many states that I'm talking about, they don't have a problem. We have some big problems, but it's confined to certain areas, high-density areas. So why would we test the entire nation — 350 [million] people? With that being said, I'm going to say it again: We tested far more than anybody else. We are — we have the ability to test — I mean, we've come a long way from an obsolete, broken system that I inherited. We have now tested, with the best test, far more than anybody else. And when I say “anybody else,” I'm talking about other countries. No country is even close."
3567,2020-04-05,"They came out with a statistic, I guess yesterday, that I heard from Dr. Birx where it's for eight — eight days here, more than eight weeks in South Korea. And South Korea has done a good job. But we did in eight days more than South Korea did in eight weeks. That's a big number."
3568,2020-04-05,"And we're getting, I said before, exponentially better. Every day, it's going up substantially. We have an incredible apparatus built now. But, no, I don't want to test 350 million people. I think it's ridiculous. Yes, please."
3569,2020-04-05,With respect to what?
3570,2020-04-05,"Look, we have strong borders. Yeah."
3571,2020-04-05,"So, before I came here, we weren't into borders. We had a country — people could come in. We had a whole different deal. Now we're up to almost 164 miles. Think of that: 164 miles of wall. Big, beautiful wall. And in those areas, it's very, very tough to come in. We've been very tough on the borders. I mean, where we have the wall built, nobody is getting through. Now, they're going around, but that's a long trip. If they're going around, that's the way they get through."
3572,2020-04-05,"But, no, I'm very strong on borders and I don't want people coming in here. What I want is, if they're going to come in, they have to come in legally. They have to come in through merit. We're not having the people that you're talking about come into our country."
3573,2020-04-05,All right. Please.
3574,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3575,2020-04-05,"Well, I'll tell you what: I approved that, and I knew — it was $35 million, and we actually took off $10 [million]. But I'm a fan of that, although I haven't spent time there because I'm far too busy. I'd love to go there evenings, but I'm too busy doing things because that's more important for me than going there. But the Kennedy Center has suffered greatly because nobody can go there. It's essentially closed, and they do need some funding. And I said, “Look...” — that was a Democrat request. That was not my request. But you got to give them something. It's something that they wanted. You know, it works that way."
3576,2020-04-05,"The Democrats have treated us fairly. I really believe that we've had a very good back and forth, and I say that with respect to Chuck Schumer. I spoke to him a number of times. But, you know, they had requests also. So that was a request. They were at $35 [million] as you know, and it came down to $25 [million]. We got it down to $25 [million], and we agreed. I said, “That's a lousy soundbite."
3577,2020-04-05,That's not a good soundbite.” But that's the way life works.
3578,2020-04-05,"With that being said, the Kennedy Center, they do a beautiful job — an incredible job. David Rubenstein does a fantastic job. He is very much involved and he puts up a lot of money, and he does things that a lot of people wouldn't be able to do or do. But they've been essentially closed. They have tremendous deficits that are built up. I mean, this thing has been devastating to it."
3579,2020-04-05,So I didn't have a big problem with it. But this was a request from the Democrats because of the fact that they have a facility that's essentially closed up. Yeah.
3580,2020-04-05,"In other words, you couldn't go there if you wanted to. If I wanted to go there tonight to look at “Romeo and Juliet” — I'd love to see “Romeo and Juliet” tonight, right? You know what would happen? They'd say, “Sorry.” Two hundred and fifty people or fifty people, whatever it might be down to."
3581,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
3582,2020-04-05,"Well, I think there is a lot of — certainly a lot of talk that has been very unfair. I think that a lot of people feel that. It's been very unfair. It's been very — very much sided with China, and a lot of people are not happy about it."
3583,2020-04-05,"At the same time, Dr. Fauci and myself and other people –there are people on there that we like and we know. A lot of — I think your friends are on there. A lot of good people. A lot of good professionals. I don't know, it'd be interesting to hear if you'd like to talk about the World — WHO."
3584,2020-04-05,"But the fact is that I have heard for years that that is very much biased toward China, so I don't know."
3585,2020-04-05,"Doctor, do you want to you — do you want me to get you into this political mess?"
3586,2020-04-05,"Hey, welcome to the group. (Laughter.) You know, let — let me just tell you, I've heard that for years. I spoke to him yesterday. Seems fine to me. I don't know. But we're the ones that gave the great response, and we're the ones that kept China out of here. And if I didn't do it, you'd have thousands and thousands of people died — who would've died — that are now living and happy. If I didn't do that early call on China — and nobody wanted that to happen. Everybody thought it was a — just unnecessary to do it. And if we didn't do that, thousands and thousands of people would have died, more than what's happened. So that's it."
3587,2020-04-05,"All right, maybe one more. Steve, go ahead."
3588,2020-04-05,"No coordinate — we're going to have a meeting with the 20 nations total, including us, and there'll be — it'll be a conference call tomorrow morning sometime."
3589,2020-04-05,"I look forward to people I know, I like. I think, in every instance, I like every one of them, but it'll be an interesting call. You'll be the first to know."
3590,2020-04-05,"Well, we'll be talking. I'll — I'll be speaking — I'll be speaking with Tony. I'll be speaking with Deborah. I'll be speaking with some of the people that they like and respect and they're going to bring along with them. We'll be speaking to Vice President Mike Pence and Steve, and we'll be speaking to everybody. I'm not going to do anything rash or hastily. I don't do that."
3591,2020-04-05,"But the country wants to get back to work. Our country was built to get back to work. We don't have the — a country where they say, “Hey, let's close it down for two years.” We can't do that. It's not our country."
3592,2020-04-05,"So we're going to be talking, and it could be we'll do sections of our country. There's big sections of our country that are very, you know, little affected by what's taking place. Then there are other sections that are very heavily affected, so there's a big difference."
3593,2020-04-05,"But, no, I would say by Easter we'll have a recommendation, and maybe before Easter. And at the end of the 15th day or even during the 15th day, I think we'll have some kind of a recommendation. But our country wants to get back to work, Steve."
3594,2020-04-05,"I have had so many people — and they want to practice social distancing and they want to practice no handshaking. No handshaking. They're not going to go walk around hugging and kissing each other in the office when they come back, even though they may feel like it. They're going to do — they're going to wash their hands more than they've ever done. They're going to do all the things you're supposed to do."
3595,2020-04-05,"But, Steve, you know what? It's — it's time. They want — people want to get back to work. I'm having — I get — you know, I get it from both sides, in all fairness, and maybe it's a combination of both. Tony said before, a combination of both is — is sometimes very good."
3596,2020-04-05,"But there are areas that possibly, probably they won't qualify. There are other areas that qualify almost now. So we're going to have to see what happens, but it'll be an interesting period of time. I'd like to get our country back. I have tremendous numbers of people wanting to go back. You have store owners where the store is sitting there. They don't know what's happened; they've got to get back. You have businesses that are going to be closed. The longer we stay out, the longer we do it — we want to go quickly. The longer we stay out, the harder it is to bring this incredible — we were having the most successful years that we've ever had in the history of our country."
3597,2020-04-05,"You saw what happened yesterday with the stocks, and today they're up. I'm telling you, if Steve gets the deal done — the incredible incentive deal — it's going to take care of people, it's going to take care of our workers, it's going to take care of companies that employ all these workers — small and big."
3598,2020-04-05,"By the way, I would say we spend more time on the small companies, Steve, than we did on the big companies. You know, people ask about that. We spend more time thinking about the small businesses than the big, and that's been — you know that really fuels our country. We want to get back, and the people want to get back. We want to get our — our country going again and we'll be able to do that."
3599,2020-04-05,"So, the Vice President is going to stay with you and going to take a few more questions, specifically, and I will see you tomorrow."
3600,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
3601,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Been a very busy day. I want to thank the American people for the incredible sacrifices that they're making on behalf of our nation. And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on social distancing: avoiding large gatherings and hand washing, and all of the other things that everybody knows they're supposed to be doing."
3602,2020-04-05,"Ultimately, the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy. Been going for a while, but we'll win. We'll win."
3603,2020-04-05,"I said earlier today that I hope we can do this by Easter. I think that would be a great thing for our country, and we're all working very hard to make that a reality. We'll be meeting with a lot of people to see if it can be done. Easter is a very special day for many reasons. For me, for a lot of — a lot of our friends, that's a very special day. And what a great timeline this would be. Easter, as our timeline — what a great timeline that would be."
3604,2020-04-05,"My first priority is always the health and safety of the American people, and we want everyone to understand that we are continuing to evaluate the data. We're working with the task force and making decisions based on what is best for the interests of our fantastic country."
3605,2020-04-05,"In order to defeat the virus, we must continue to be very strong. Your resilience and spirit has been inspiring to everyone. Right now, this virus is attacking 149 countries, but everybody looks to us and they're watching us."
3606,2020-04-05,And I'm very proud to be your President — I can tell you that. There's tremendous hope as we look forward and we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Stay focused and stay strong. And my administration and myself will deliver for you as we have in the past.
3607,2020-04-05,"Let me provide you an update on critical preparations and supplies in our war on the virus. Through FEMA, the federal government is distributing more than 8 million N95 respirators, 14 million surgical masks, and many, many millions more are under order, and they'll be arriving soon. 2.4 million face shields, 1.9 million surgical gowns, 13.5 million gloves, and more than 4,000 ventilators to the areas of greatest need have already been sent. And we have 4,000 being delivered to New York."
3608,2020-04-05,"The federal government is using every resource at its disposal to acquire and distribute critical medical supplies. The core element of this strategy is my executive order authorizing the use of the Defense Production Act, which has, as you know, already been activated, actually, a long time ago — quite a long time ago."
3609,2020-04-05,"Private companies are heeding our call to produce medical equipment and supplies because they know that we will not hesitate to invoke the DPA in order to get them to do what they have to do. It's called leverage. You don't have to use it from the standpoint of — actually, it's been activated, but you don't have to use it. But the threat of it being there is great leverage. And companies are doing as we ask, and companies are actually — even better than that, they're coming through and they're calling us. And it's been, really, something to see."
3610,2020-04-05,"This morning, Ford, 3M, and General Electric Healthcare are making tremendous numbers — they've already started — of respirators ventilators and face shields. They're working together. We didn't have to exercise or utilize the DPA in any way. The fact that we have it helps, but we didn't have to. And for the most part, we won't have to."
3611,2020-04-05,We're receiving full cooperation from companies with the understanding that the federal government stands ready to compel cooperation if need be. We haven't found that to be the case.
3612,2020-04-05,"It's been really amazing to see these big, strong, powerful — in some cases, very small companies, family-owned companies, step up and make a lot of great product for what we're going through and what we will continue to be going through for a while."
3613,2020-04-05,"The Army Corps of Engineers and the National Guard are building four hospital facilities in New York City at the Javits Center, which will be operational very soon. They've already started."
3614,2020-04-05,"In addition, they're building four separate medical facilities in different parts of the state. We're dealing with Governor Cuomo on that. So you're going to have four hospitals and four medical facilities at the highest level, too. Really incredible facilities. Temporary but incredible."
3615,2020-04-05,"We're also deploying the U.S. Navy hospital ship, and that will be arriving in New York Harbor in the not-too-distant future. It's finishing its maintenance. They're doing a very big maintenance, and what we did is we condensed it very seriously. And, as you know, the other hospital ship — and these are incredible ships — it's already on its way to Los Angeles."
3616,2020-04-05,"So we're in frequent contact with state and local officials, and getting a lot of work done. We're, likewise, building hospitals in Los Angeles. We're working also — the State of Washington. We're working with the governor of the State of New Jersey. We're building a medical facility, a hospital facility, and doing a lot of work."
3617,2020-04-05,I want to thank the people from FEMA — the great people from FEMA — and also the Army Corps of Engineers.
3618,2020-04-05,"Secretary Mnuchin and the members of my administration continue to work closely with Congress. I'm pleased to report that we are working to pass the biggest and boldest financial relief package in American history. Senators will soon, hopefully, vote on a $2 trillion bill that will deliver direct cash payments to struggling Americans. No fault of their own. This came out of nowhere. Nobody can imagine this even happened. But it's not their fault."
3619,2020-04-05,"We want to protect, and we will, all of the things that a person needs protected and a family needs protected. We're working on job retention, loans for small businesses, and extended unemployment insurance for laid-off workers."
3620,2020-04-05,"The legislation will also include billions of dollars for additional resources for our, really, heroic — these are incredible doctors, nurses — brave — and hospitals, as well as support for hard-hit industries such as the airline industry and the cruise ship industry, which employ tremendous amounts of people and obviously serve very important functions beyond that."
3621,2020-04-05,"With very tough protections for the American taxpayer, the loans will be very secure and they will be very profitable and, at the same time, they'll bridge — they call them bridge loans. In many cases, they'll be bridging these companies back into very good health. Some of them are very important companies that four weeks ago didn't have a problem."
3622,2020-04-05,I'm also confident that the Democrats will do the right thing. I feel very confident. They're working very hard together right now — Republicans and Democrats — and they're getting very close to a very fair deal and a great deal for the people of our country.
3623,2020-04-05,"Today, as you probably saw, the Dow surged over 2,100 points. That's the all-time record in history of the Exchange. This is very encouraging. And I think part of the reason is they are looking at what is close to being passed, and I think a very big part of it is they see that we want to get our country opened as soon as possible. They see we're working very hard on that. That's a very big factor, I think, in today's historic gain."
3624,2020-04-05,"The legislation developed in the Senate is the first step to restoring confidence and stability to America's economy as we look ahead to the time when we can carefully and responsibly reopen our country for business, and we hope that's going to be very soon."
3625,2020-04-05,"I want to assure Americans that we have a team of public health experts. You've gotten to know them as well as I know them; they're great people. Incredible. Talented. They love our country. Also, economists and other professionals working to develop a sophisticated plan to reopen the economy as soon as the time is right — one based on the best science, the best modeling, and the best medical research there is anywhere on Earth."
3626,2020-04-05,"Our great people have been — especially when it comes to our public health experts and officials — have been helping other countries, dealing with other countries, constant touch with other countries, helping them out, because many of them have never seen anything like what's happening."
3627,2020-04-05,"But our decision will be based on hard facts and data as to the opening. I'm also hopeful to have Americans working again by that Easter — that beautiful Easter day. But rest assured, every decision we make is grounded solely on the health, safety, and wellbeing of our citizens."
3628,2020-04-05,"This is a medical crisis; this isn't a financial crisis. But it's a thing that nobody has seen for many, many decades. Nothing like this. Marshaling our economic strength is a key feature of defeating the virus, producing the material supplies and equipment that we need. And they're doing a really fantastic job. We're helping the governors. We had a conference call the other day with governors, and we allowed the press to join us in the call. And the spirit between us and the governors has been really great."
3629,2020-04-05,"We should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival. I think we've learned a lot. We've learned a lot. This crisis has underscored just how critical it is to have strong borders and a robust manufacturing sector. For three years, we've embarked on a great national project to secure our immigration system and bring back our manufacturing jobs. We brought back many jobs — records numbers — record numbers of jobs."
3630,2020-04-05,"And this really shows — this experience shows how important borders are. Without borders, you don't have a nation. Our goal for the future must be to have American medicine for American patients, American supplies for American hospitals, and American equipment for our great American heroes."
3631,2020-04-05,"Now, both parties must unite to ensure the United States is truly an independent nation in every sense of the word. Energy independence — we've established that. That's something incredible that we have established. We're energy independent, manufacturing independence, economic independence, and territorial independence enforced by strong, sovereign borders."
3632,2020-04-05,"America will never be a supplicant nation. We will be a proud, prosperous, independent, and self-reliant nation. We will embrace commerce with all, but we will be dependent on none."
3633,2020-04-05,"Above all, we know that the best thing for our economy and the world right now is a very, very powerful victory over the virus. Every day, the American people and showing the unity and resolve that has always defined the character of our nation."
3634,2020-04-05,"In New York, citizens are using 3D printers to make hundreds of the face shields. They're making them by the hundreds. In Texas, businesses and churches are uniting to collect gloves and thermometers for hospitals."
3635,2020-04-05,"In the selfless actions of our amazing citizens, we're seeing enduring strength of our magnificent nation, a spirit that can never be broken, and a victorious future that can never be denied. It never will be denied."
3636,2020-04-05,"Now, what I'd like to do is, perhaps, ask a person who has really established herself as maybe the world's great expert on what she does — if I could ask Deborah to come forward and say a few words. And then I'll ask Tony to come up and speak, and then our Vice President. And then we'll take a few questions, and we'll do it quickly. And we'll probably see you again tomorrow."
3637,2020-04-05,"So, Deborah, please."
3638,2020-04-05,"Well, thank you, Tony. Great job."
3639,2020-04-05,"Larry, how about just a quick few minutes on how we're doing over at the Hill, please?"
3640,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Larry. I've been hearing that voice for so many years — like 30 years or more, maybe. And it's a great voice and it's a great man. So Larry Kudlow, thank you very much."
3641,2020-04-05,"I want to say that that package — and we went over parts of it, but pretty big parts — it really sets us up to, I think, even supersede where we were a month ago. I think we can get up there quickly and I think it allows us to supersede. It allows us to help these great companies that need help, like Boeing, which is — you know, it had a problem and then, on top of that problem, it had the virus come in. But we'll be helping Boeing. We'll be helping the airlines. We'll be helping the cruise lines. We'll be doing a lot of things and the money will all come back to us, and it will come back to us in a very strong form."
3642,2020-04-05,"And before we take some questions, I'd like to ask our great Vice President to say a few words, if you wouldn't mind. Please."
3643,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, Mike. Thank you."
3644,2020-04-05,Kaitlan.
3645,2020-04-05,"I think we're looking at a timeline. We're discussing it. We had a very good meeting today. You know, if you add it all up, that's probably nine days plus another two and a half weeks. It's a period of time that's longer than the original two weeks."
3646,2020-04-05,"So we're going to look at it. We'll only do it if it's good. And maybe we do sections of the country; we do large sections of the country. That could be, too. But, no, we're very much in Tony and with Deborah on everything we're doing."
3647,2020-04-05,"I just thought it was a beautiful time. It would be a beautiful time, a beautiful timeline. It's a great day."
3648,2020-04-05,"It was — it was based on a certain level of weeks from the time we started. And it happened to arrive — actually, we were thinking in terms of sooner. I'd love to see if come even sooner. But I just think it would be a beautiful timeline."
3649,2020-04-05,Jon?
3650,2020-04-05,"Jon, we're working with all of them."
3651,2020-04-05,"Sure. Sure. We're working with all of them. We can be talking about large sections of our country, because there are sections of our country that you didn't talk about that are doing unbelievably well; they have very little incidents or problem — very small numbers. It's very possible that they won't be ever subject to what's happening in New York."
3652,2020-04-05,"New York is definitely a hotspot. There's no question about it. And you know what we're doing in New York to try and help, and I think we're doing an incredible job. We're going to have the hospitals up quickly — the medical centers, also, quickly."
3653,2020-04-05,But we'll just have to see. We have to follow it. We have to see. We're going to look at that curve. We're going to see when it starts coming down. And we'll do the best job that can be done.
3654,2020-04-05,"John, please."
3655,2020-04-05,I think we'll be looking at a lot of things. We'll also be looking at very large portions of our country. And I will be guided very much by Dr. Fauci and by Deborah and by some of the other professionals that work with both of you.
3656,2020-04-05,"And we're going to see what — what will be, but that would certainly be — I think that's a goal that perhaps can happen, or at least for a very large portion of our country."
3657,2020-04-05,"Well, it certainly is, by far, the — if you call it “hot,” if you call it any word you want to use. It is at a level that — I was speaking to Tony before — it's a level that no place else is close. It's very unfortunate."
3658,2020-04-05,"You know, one of the things that's — that's happened — that we've done, I think, a really good job on — I think that it's something special what's happened is I learned from Dr. Birx, a little while ago, when she said — I learned it actually this afternoon: In eight days — because we kept hearing about South Korea. And they had a very tough time at the beginning, if you remember. In eight days, we're doing more testing than they've done in eight weeks. That's a tremendous turn. And with our testing, it's going — exponentially, it's going up, up, up every day."
3659,2020-04-05,"So we're going to be able to do things with this very highly sophisticated testing. And it's also — the test itself is considered the best test. So, on top of doing now more than anybody else, we have a very high-quality test. That makes a big difference. It also makes a big difference, even in terms of opening, because we're going to see those areas like the hotspots. But New York City definitely is a very hot spot."
3660,2020-04-05,Steve.
3661,2020-04-05,"Well, you can talk about the Farm Belt. Take a look at the Farm Belt. Take a look at the areas out west. Look at big sections of Texas."
3662,2020-04-05,"I was talking to the great Governor of Texas. They have done a fantastic job out there. But they have very big sections of Texas where — you know, it's — it's like numerous states, frankly."
3663,2020-04-05,"But we can have large sections of — if we want to do it that way, we can have large sections of the country open. But I think it's very important that we start moving on that and start thinking about it, because our country wants to be open, our people want it to be open, and they want it — they want — they're raring to go. And I think it's one of the reasons that we're going to have a tremendous bounce back. I think it's going to go very quickly."
3664,2020-04-05,"Also, I want to thank — while I'm here, I want to thank Larry for the job he's done, Steve Mnuchin for the job he's done. If you look at Peter Navarro, he's sort of doing different things. He's really — he's a force, in terms of getting masks and getting all of the ventilators and all the things. He's been fantastic — Peter."
3665,2020-04-05,"But I also want to thank Congress because whether or not we're happy that they haven't quite gotten there yet, they have been working long hours. I'm talking Republicans and Democrats — all of them. The House, the Senate. I want to thank Congress because they are really trying to get there, and I think they will."
3666,2020-04-05,And I'll see you all tomorrow. Thank you very much. Thank you.
3667,2020-04-05,Beg your pardon?
3668,2020-04-05,We're talking to them about it.
3669,2020-04-05,"Okay. Thank you very much. Please. Thank you. A big day today at the White House. All of American society is engaged and mobilized in the war against the invisible enemy. While we must remain vigilant, it is clear that our aggressive strategy is working — and very strongly working, I might add."
3670,2020-04-05,"New cases are declining throughout the New York metropolitan area. Cases in the Detroit and Denver metro areas are flat. Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Philadelphia; and St. Louis are showing great signs of progress, and new cases in Houston and New Orleans are declining."
3671,2020-04-05,"The battle continues, but the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases. Hopefully that will continue and we will continue to make great progress."
3672,2020-04-05,"These encouraging developments have put us in a very strong position to finalize guidelines for states on reopening the country, which we'll be announcing. We're going to be talking about that tomorrow. We'll be having a news conference tomorrow sometime during the afternoon. We're going to be announcing guidelines, and we'll be talking about various states. And it's very exciting."
3673,2020-04-05,"It's been a horrible time to see such death and destruction, especially when you come out of what was the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest. There's never been an economy like what we had produced, but we'll produce it again. And I think we'll produce it again very fast."
3674,2020-04-05,"The medical and healthcare advances we've made are critical to our continued progress. We've rapidly developed the most expansive and accurate testing system anywhere in the world and have completed more than 3.3 million tests. To date, we have authorized 48 separate coronavirus tests, and the FDA is working with 300 companies and labs to widen our capacity still further."
3675,2020-04-05,"Today, Abbott Labs announced that it has developed an antibody test that will determine if someone has been previously infected with the coronavirus and potentially developed immunity. It's a great test. The company says these tests could be available to screen up to 20 million people in a matter of weeks."
3676,2020-04-05,"My administration is also distributing vast amounts of medical supplies to states across the country through Project Air Bridge, which has been an amazing success. We have completed 44 flights — and these are flights of very, very large airplanes, massive cargo planes — 44 flights of critical supplies as of today and an additional 56 flights scheduled in the near future. We have some very brilliant people working on this. It's logistically incredible what they've done. And we've also been working on this with the military. And these people have been — the genius of all of them together, it has been incredible to watch."
3677,2020-04-05,"In total, through all channels, the federal government has developed and delivered 39.4 million N95 masks, 431 million gloves, 57 million surgical masks, and 10.2 million gowns. We ordered 500 million masks, and they'll be coming shortly. And we've distributed 100 million masks."
3678,2020-04-05,"Following our use of the Defense Production Act, GM announced that its first ventilators come off the assembly line in Kokomo, Indiana — a great place. They did it in 11 days, from start to finish, a remarkable testament to the ingenuity of the American worker. GM will ship over 600 ventilators this month alone, with thousands more to come. And we have other companies doing something similar."
3679,2020-04-05,"And I think they said that there's a brief clip that we have of General Motors, sent to us by General Motors. And I think they might be wanting to play that for your benefit. Please."
3680,2020-04-05,"I know you got a little bit nervous when you saw there was a clip about ready to be played, but that was sent to us by General Motors, and we thought it would be a good one to play. It's amazing. It's — you know, what they've done in a very, very short period of time."
3681,2020-04-05,"They're now making thousands of ventilators, and they're coming out of the factory very rapidly, at a clip that nobody can even believe. But we have others also doing it. And these are very high-grade ventilators. So we're helping a lot of people. And at this moment, nobody needs them. We have to remember, during the surge, nobody has needed him for weeks now."
3682,2020-04-05,"But we'll have them for stockpiles, and very importantly, we're going to have them for other countries because nobody is able to do things like we can do. And we're going to be able to help other countries that are having tremendous problems, to put it mildly."
3683,2020-04-05,"My administration is using every available authority to accelerate the development, study, and delivery of therapies — so important, therapies — treatments, and ultimately, what we want to come up with is a safe vaccine. But frankly, the therapies, to me, are the most important because it takes care of people right now. The vaccines have to be tested, so it takes a longer period of time. But we have some great potential therapies already, and we'll see how they're working. We'll be able to report on that, I think, over the next week or two. Tremendous progress has been made."
3684,2020-04-05,"At least 35 clinical trials of promising therapies are now underway. So 35 different genius companies. If you look at AIDS, if you look at Ebola, if you look at so many things, they've come up with the answers to so many things, you wouldn't have believed it. And we're very honored to be working with them."
3685,2020-04-05,"They include antivirals, and also — and they — something which is incredible: It keeps the virus from multiplying. A mechanism that keeps the virus from multiplying. Immune therapies that prevent the immune system from overreaching to the virus. And convalescent plasma treatments that use antibodies from the blood of recovered patients."
3686,2020-04-05,"And we have a lot of patients who recover, and they're so happy to have recovered that the first thing they do is say, “We want to give our blood.” And they do that. It's incredible. We have thousands of people that are doing that. They recover and they feel they have an obligation because they've gotten such great care. And a lot of them didn't think they were going to make it."
3687,2020-04-05,"As the entire U.S. government works to combat the global pandemic, it is absolutely essential that the key positions at relevant federal agencies are fully staffed. And we're not allowing that to take place through our Congress. They're just not — they're just not giving it to us. We have many, many positions that are unstaffed because we can't get the approvals. The Democrats are holding us up. We cannot get approval."
3688,2020-04-05,"We've gotten judges because we go through the process. I guess we're up to 448 federal judges. And that, we've gotten because we focus on it; we take the maximum time. Because no matter who the judge is, they take vast numbers of days and hours to approve, and it leaves no time left for others. Very unfair system."
3689,2020-04-05,"If a judge is going to be approved in one hour, in one session, it doesn't matter — they'll take the maximum number of hours and days — you're talking about days — to get one judge approved. And we're close to 250 judges, but because of the way they're doing it, there's no time for anybody else. And many of these people have been waiting for two and a half years. We have a couple that have been waiting for longer than that."
3690,2020-04-05,"There are currently 129 nominees stuck in the Senate because of partisan obstruction. Many are nominated for vacancies that must be filled to assist with the coronavirus crisis and the resulting economic challenges. And I've read, over the last couple of years, “Well, I didn't fill positions.” I don't fill positions — in some cases, we don't need the position, and I'm all for that. But in many cases, you do, but we can't get them approved by the Democrats. They won't release them."
3691,2020-04-05,"The positions include the Director of National Intelligence, two members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Financial Markets of the United States, and the Undersecretary of Agriculture responsible for administering food security programs. And Sonny Perdue, who's going to be speaking today, is saying, “Please, can I have this man, can I have this particular person approved as soon as possible?” He's been telling me that for a long time, and the Democrats won't allow it to happen."
3692,2020-04-05,"Again, every single judge, every nominee we have goes through maximum, or at least they go through a long process. So it takes days and days, and there's no time left. And it's just a concerted effort to make life difficult."
3693,2020-04-05,"An example is Michael Pack. He's my nominee for the CEO of the Broadcasking [sic] — Broadcasting Board of Governors. And he's been stuck in committee for two years, preventing us from managing the Voice of America. Very important."
3694,2020-04-05,"And if you heard what's coming out of the Voice of America, it's disgusting. What — things they say are disgusting toward our country. And Michael Pack would get in and he'd do a great job, but he's been waiting now for two years. Can't get him approved."
3695,2020-04-05,"The senators left Washington until at least May 4th. The Constitution provides a mechanism for the President to fill positions in such circumstances — the “recess appointment,” it's called — the Senate's practice of dabbling into so-called pro forma sessions where no one is even there. It has prevented me from using the constitutional authority that we're giving — that we're given under the recess provisions."
3696,2020-04-05,"The Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so that I can make recess appointments. We have a tremendous number of people that have to come into government — and now more so than ever before, because of the virus and the problem. We have to do it, and we have to do whatever we have to do. They've made it very, very difficult to run government. I don't think any administration has done anywhere near what we've done in three and a half years."
3697,2020-04-05,"But every block — every week, they put up roadblocks, whether it's “Russia, Russia, Russia,” or whether it's impeachment hoax, or whatever it may be. It's always roadblocks and a waste of time."
3698,2020-04-05,"If the House will not agree to that adjournment, I will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress. The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis. It is a scam, what they do. It's a scam, and everybody knows it. And it's been that way for a long time. And perhaps it's never done before — it's never been done before; nobody is even sure if it has. But we're going to do it. We need these people here. We need people for this crisis, and we don't want to play any more political games."
3699,2020-04-05,"I've been waiting for two and a half years, three years, for some of these people. And they're great people. They left law firms. They left jobs. They gave up everything to do it. And they've been waiting for three years, two and a half years, two years, one year to get approved. It's ridiculous. And everyone knows they're going to be approved. But there's only so many hours in the day, when you go through judges and you go through a lengthy hearings on judges that they know should be approved immediately. And they could do it in one session, one — and they could do it in one hour. And instead, it takes them many days."
3700,2020-04-05,"In order to advance the health and security of our nation and all nations, as we announced yesterday, the U.S. government has put a hold on funding to the WHO — World Health Organization — pending a review of the organization's cover-up and mismanagement of the coronavirus outbreak. Over the objections of the WHO, we took decisive action and early lifesaving action to suspend travel from China. They didn't want to do it. They were angry that we did it. It was early on. They were angry that we did it. Took them a long time to realize what was going on, but I have a feeling they know exactly what was going on."
3701,2020-04-05,"Tragically, other nations put their trust in the WHO and they didn't do any form of ban. And you see what happened to Italy. You see what happened to Spain. You see what happened to France. WHO's guidance had failed to control their borders at a very crucial phase, quickly unleashing the contagion around the world. That was a horrible, tragic mistake — or perhaps they knew. I'm sure they didn't know the gravity of it, but perhaps they knew. Because if they knew the gravity, that would be an even worse offense."
3702,2020-04-05,"To ease the economic pain of millions of American families, we've now processed $300 billion in loans to more than 1 million small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. This action has saved millions of American jobs. It's been an incredible success. And they want to replenish it now, but, again, the Democrats don't want to do that. This is money that goes to the workers of our country."
3703,2020-04-05,"Phase one was $350 billion dollars. And now phase two, we want to do $250 billion. This goes to workers and it goes to small businesses so we can save all the small businesses around our nation."
3704,2020-04-05,"Mike McFarland from Nebraska recently said this historic relief has been a godsend for his small factory, and the 136 Americans who work there. He saved those jobs. Another small business owner, Tim Miller from Oklahoma, called the program a total lifesaver for his auto-repair shop's four employees. Stories like these underscore why Congress must replenish the Paycheck Protection Program immediately. The Republicans want to do it; they want to do it immediately. They want to do it now. And the Democrats are stopping it."
3705,2020-04-05,"A short time ago, CDC issued public health guidelines for critical industries. In a few moments, Agricultural Secretary Sonny Perdue will elaborate on how these guidelines apply to our nation's dedicated workers in the food processing profession — because it's a profession. It's incredible what they do: food processing. And they're keeping our grocery stores full. The shelves are not bare like the shelves that I inherited when we took over the stockpile — the medical stockpile, where the shelves were bare. “The cupboard was bare,” I say."
3706,2020-04-05,"Tomorrow, I'll also be leading a call with elected officials who will consult with my administration as we work to restore our economy to full speed. And we really think, with all of the stimulus and all of the pent-up demand, we're going to have an economy that really comes back quickly. And we'd like to see it more than match what we had before. What we had before was a miracle. And we think this is going to be even more than a miracle. We're going to do it because we have the greatest people in the world."
3707,2020-04-05,We'll also be speaking to America's governors tomorrow and then we'll be announcing exactly what's happening. You already know we'll be opening up states — some states much sooner than others. And we think some of the states can actually open up before the deadline of May 1st. And I think that that will be a very exciting time indeed.
3708,2020-04-05,"Governors are looking forward — they're chomping at the bit to get going. Again, not all states are the same. They're very different. Some are having very little problems. Some have done such a good job that they have very little problem and they're ready to go. So, Vice President Pence and I will be speaking with the governors tomorrow. We'll be discussing procedures."
3709,2020-04-05,"Today, I spoke with the leaders of many of our nation's most renowned companies and organizations on how to achieve the full resurgence of the American economy. My discussions included top leaders in health and healthcare, transportation technology, financial services, food, beverages, hospitality, real estate, retail, agriculture, construction, energy, labor, manufacturing, and sports industries."
3710,2020-04-05,We want to get our country open again. We want to have our sports leagues open. You want to watch sports. It's important. We miss sports. We miss everything. We want to get back.
3711,2020-04-05,"These experts and innovators provided extremely productive feedback on how to safely reboot our economy. They gave us a lot of great ideas. We spoke to a lot of very, very smart people — the highest of the high-tech. The level of IQ on some of those calls was about the highest you've ever seen on a phone call, that I can tell you."
3712,2020-04-05,"But we have a lot of great thought went into those calls, and a lot of questions came out and also statements — very strong statements, as to what they recommend. It was — I think it was a great day. We did a lot of — a lot of calling with a lot of very prominent people — but, more importantly, very smart people and people that love our country."
3713,2020-04-05,"They talked about the vital importance of our wide array of relief measures to address the present crisis, and they provided valuable insights on how to move forward, including on the role of protective gear, where we have tremendous amounts of protective gear coming in; robust testing; and the future use of therapies and treatments."
3714,2020-04-05,"They also underscored the crucial importance of strong supply chains and communications infrastructure. We're talking about infrastructure for the middle of our country. We're talking about broadband and things that they, frankly, don't have and haven't had for a long time because a lot of politicians forgot about them. You can't forget about them. They're really the heart and soul. You can't forget about them."
3715,2020-04-05,"And we're talking about the telemedical. It's a new thing, and it's incredible what they've been able to do. This is an industry that's just growing, but it's take — it's grown by leaps and bounds over the last five weeks. People are learning so much. Without the ability to see a doctor, they're learning so much and a lot of good things are happening. That's something that's really, going forward, I think, going to be very important for our country."
3716,2020-04-05,"As we've seen throughout our proud history, America is never greater than when our people are working in unison toward a common goal. That's what's happening right now. We'll go ahead. We'll forge an even brighter future today than we had. And we'll be — along with other nations, hopefully; we're working with other nations — we'll be the comeback kids. All of us. All of us."
3717,2020-04-05,"It's incredible what's going on. I'm very proud of the people of this country. I'm very proud of the people I spoke to today. These are truly great, brilliant people, and we've gained tremendous insight."
3718,2020-04-05,"So tomorrow is going to be a very big day. We're going to be speaking with the governors. We'll have some information on some openings. And again, we'll have some openings that will be — will exceed our expectations. And they'll be safe, they'll be strong, but we want to get our country back. We want to get our country back. And we're going to do it and we're going to do it soon."
3719,2020-04-05,"With that, I'd like to ask Dr. Birx to come up and say a few words, and then Secretary Sonny Perdue, and then Vice President Pence. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you."
3720,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Thank you, Doctor."
3721,2020-04-05,"Sonny, please."
3722,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. And before the Vice President comes up, I just wanted to say, speaking of Sonny, China has paid us billions of dollars — many, many billions of dollars — in tariffs, which we've distributed — some to the farmers, because they were targeted. We have many billions of dollars being held by Sonny. And I've told him to distribute much of that money to the farmers."
3723,2020-04-05,"Our farmers were targeted and now they're benefiting by the amount that they were targeted. And we are very honored to do that. And, Sonny, you're going to start that process very soon. You'll let the farmers know. Nobody can take advantage of our farmers."
3724,2020-04-05,So we have a lot of money that we've taken in from China. We're going to be distributing that money from — from Sonny to the farmers. And there is tremendous money over and above that. That money was paid directly into the Treasury of the United States.
3725,2020-04-05,This has never happened to China before. They never gave us 10 cents. Now they're paying us billions of dollars and we appreciate it.
3726,2020-04-05,"So thank you very much, Sonny. Great job."
3727,2020-04-05,"Please. Mike, please."
3728,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Mike. Great. Thank you, Mike."
3729,2020-04-05,"Steve, please."
3730,2020-04-05,"Very simple: If they don't act on getting these people approved that we need because of the — we need them anyway, but we especially need now because of the pandemic — we are going to do something that will be something I'd prefer not doing, but which I should do and I will do if I have to."
3731,2020-04-05,"Kaitlan, go ahead."
3732,2020-04-05,Sure.
3733,2020-04-05,"It's what I want too. And we have great tests. And we want the states to administer these tests, for the most part. But we're standing behind them. We have great tests. We've done more testing now than any country, as you know, in the world, by far."
3734,2020-04-05,"We have the best tests of any country in the world. Nobody have — has the quality of tests, the — if you look at Abbott, what they've come up with in a short period of time. They've been incredible. Roche has been incredible. We have the best tests in the world."
3735,2020-04-05,"And we will be working very much with the governors of the states. We want them to do it. We're not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas. We're not going to be running a parking lot, where you have a Walmart — which has been great, by the way; Walmart has done a fantastic job — but where you have a testing center and running that from Washington, D.C. The states are much better equipped to do it."
3736,2020-04-05,"But we'll be working with the states. We're standing behind the states. We're going to work very closely with the governors, in terms of that — getting additional equipment. It used to be three, four weeks ago — two weeks ago, “Can we get more ventilators?” More ventilators, right? And we got them ventilators, and you don't hear that anymore. It's been pretty amazing, what we've been able to do."
3737,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Go ahead, Jon."
3738,2020-04-05,"Well, I think the companies will determine that, and the governors will determine that, and the federal government will de- — and if we're not happy, we'll take very strong action against a state or a governor. If we're not happy with the job a governor is doing, we'll let them know about it. And, as you know, we have very strong action we can take, including a closedown, but we don't want to do that."
3739,2020-04-05,We're working with the governors and we're working closely with the governors. The relationship has been very good. The Vice President has had a lot of conversations over the last two weeks with either 50 or almost 50 governors on every conversation. And they've been really positive conversations.
3740,2020-04-05,"Well, we have the right to do whatever we want. But we wouldn't do that. But, no, we would have the right to close down what they're doing if we want to do that. But we don't want to do that —"
3741,2020-04-05,"— and I don't think there'll be any reason to do that, but we have the right to do that."
3742,2020-04-05,Steve? Go ahead. Go ahead.
3743,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know too much about it, but I understand my name is there. I don't know where they're going, how they're going. I do understand it's not delaying anything. And I'm satisfied with that. I don't — I don't imagine it's a big deal. I'm sure people will be very happy to get a big, fat, beautiful check and my name is on it."
3744,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Go ahead, please."
3745,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please. Please."
3746,2020-04-05,Please. Please. Go ahead.
3747,2020-04-05,"Well, the governors can control that flow, as an example. In fact, I just saw, a little while ago, it was reported that certain borders are being controlled already by states. They're starting to take control of their borders, which is good. So they'll be controlling. They may do testing for people wanting to come in; I'd read that about Rhode Island. So they have to watch it. They have to be very careful."
3748,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. In the back."
3749,2020-04-05,"So our relationship with Canada is very good. We'll talk about that. It will be one of the early borders to be released. Canada is doing well. We're doing well. We'll see. But at some point, we'll be doing that."
3750,2020-04-05,"In the meantime, nations that are heavily infected — we have a lot of nations that are heavily infected. Some are getting better. Some are still on the way up, unfortunately. We're keeping very strong borders with those nations. But with Canada, we are talking about different things."
3751,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
3752,2020-04-05,"Well, all we're doing is looking at the numbers, we're looking at our graphs, we're looking at our models. We're getting a great response from Deborah and from Tony and from many of the professionals that are working. We have great professionals working with us. And, I think, based on that, we're — we're doing very well."
3753,2020-04-05,"Based on that, it looks like we're headed absolutely in the right direction. But some states are looking at other states, and they're saying, “I can't imagine what they're going through” — because they're not in that position. They're in very good shape."
3754,2020-04-05,"I would say that we have 20 states, at least, but you really have 29 that are in extremely good shape. You have others that are getting much better. And I think, with almost a few exceptions, you have every state that is either doing better or on the way to doing better."
3755,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
3756,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead."
3757,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
3758,2020-04-05,"Well, it is — it's — look, it's been a very partisan government for a long period of time, not just this administration. You can go back into the last two administrations; you've seen a lot of partisanship. And even now, you would think that we wouldn't have."
3759,2020-04-05,"As an example, with the Paycheck Plan, that's going so well. It's so smooth, so beautiful, almost without a hitch. All of that money is being distributed to small businesses. They're giving it to their employees. It's keeping them ready, viable. So when we open — and now, it's been so good that it's almost depleted and we want to replenish it, and we can't get the Democrats to approve it. And that's a program that they and everybody else admit that are great."
3760,2020-04-05,"So, you do have partisanship. We have been trying for years to get people approved for positions. People have left — one man left a law firm. One man left a — a big chain. He was a very successful executive; he left. It was two years ago. We have people that have been waiting for three years. And we can't get them approved by the Democrats in the Senate because they're taking so long to approve our judges."
3761,2020-04-05,"Now, I have to tell you that I'm totally in favor of what Mitch is doing with judges, because that's — always seems to be a priority and it's a very important priority. I think it's one of the great trademarks of this administration: We've approved record numbers of federal judges and appellate judges and two Supreme Court judges."
3762,2020-04-05,"But rather than approving somebody who's highly qualified — somebody that everybody knows is going to be approved — rather than going quickly, they take the maximum amount of time, whatever that time may be. And what they're doing by doing that is taking days to approve somebody that could be approved in a quick vote. People that get phenomenal reviews in committee are going maximum number of hours. And what they do is — there's only so many hours in a day."
3763,2020-04-05,"Now, we could have said, “Let's stay.” I would have been in favor of that. They didn't choose to do it. But I have a very strong power. I'd rather not use that power, but we have way over 100 people that we very badly need in this administration that should have been approved a long time ago. And one of them is the head of Voice of America. If you look at what they're doing and what they're saying about our country, it's a disgrace — the people that are running that. We have somebody that's really good, really talented, and that loves our country. And I want to get these people approved."
3764,2020-04-05,"That's one of many. We have professionals. Sonny, you've been waiting for — how long have you been waiting for the man that we're talking about coming in?"
3765,2020-04-05,"Two and a half years. So Sonny Perdue just happens to be here talking about something else. So you've been waiting for one of the most important position, as Secretary of Agriculture, is the position — it's distribution. We need it now. We're talking about shelves. We're talking about cupboards. He needs it. He's been waiting — he didn't know he was going to get this question. You've been waiting two and a half years."
3766,2020-04-05,"The person is exceptional. That person left a very good job. And it's embarrassing to me. He'll say, “Do you think you'll get that man approved?” He's been saying that to me for a long time. It's because of the Democrats."
3767,2020-04-05,"And what we're doing is — and I think anybody here would do it — judges are a priority. A federal judge is going to sit for 50 years, potentially — a young judge. Going to be sitting for — that's always going to have to be a priority."
3768,2020-04-05,But because they're taking so much time and approving every — they're trying to put us through the mill. That's — when you talk about partisanship — and it's never ever happened before. You can look at every administration in the history of this country. Nobody — nobody has ever had hundreds of people not approved after three and a half years.
3769,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
3770,2020-04-05,"Well, we'll know soon. Look, they know. I — they've been warned and they're being warned right now. If they don't approve it, then we're going to go this route. And we'll probably be challenged in court, and we'll see who wins."
3771,2020-04-05,"But when the court hears that we aren't getting people approved — as Sonny would say, for two and a half years — for an important position that we need because of this crisis — we needed these people before, but now we really need these people."
3772,2020-04-05,"Well, we are. There has to be a balance. You know, there's also death involved in keeping it closed. And I've gone over this with you, and I believe this so strongly. When you look at mental health, when you look at suicides; suicide hotlines, which are exploding; people losing their jobs. When you look at drugs, and people that didn't take drugs and now they're becoming drug addicted because they're going through a problem. They have no job. They have no money coming in — other than the money we're getting them. We've opened up the coffers to a large extent. We're helping people."
3773,2020-04-05,"This is why I wish the Democrats would help us a little bit with it, because they should. It's purely partisan what they're doing, and it's bad for our country. But — but, you know, there is death by doing — by having this strongly closed country. We have to get back to work."
3774,2020-04-05,"With all of that being said, we're going to start with states and with governors that have done a great job. And they're going to open it up as they see fit. And we're going to be right behind them. And we're — we're going to be working. We're going to be supplying them with things if they don't have them. We want them to have them."
3775,2020-04-05,"We're going to be helping them with ventilators after this is over so that they can't say, “Oh, the federal government...” We want them to have — they've had a lot of options. Many of the governors have had a lot of options, over the years, to buy ventilators. They didn't choose to do it. So we're going to be helping them to fill up their stockpiles. We're going to have plenty. And as I said, I'm very proud to do it."
3776,2020-04-05,"We're going to be helping other nations. We're going to be helping Italy, Spain, France, other nations. And we're going to be helping them strongly. I think Russia is going to need ventilators. They're having a hard time in Moscow. We're going to help them. We're going to help other countries that need ventilators."
3777,2020-04-05,We're going to have a lot. You see it with General Motors. You see it with other companies that are producing. We're going to have hundreds of thousands of ventilators. And it's a great thing to have.
3778,2020-04-05,"Yes, in the back. Please. Is anybody freezing? (Laughter.) You know, it's very cold out here. So we can leave early, right? (Laughter.)"
3779,2020-04-05,"Okay, a couple more. Go ahead. Please."
3780,2020-04-05,"Well, you don't know what you have. Do you think you're getting honest numbers from some of these countries? Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China — and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths — does anybody really believe that?"
3781,2020-04-05,"Here's the story: We report everything. We're reporting the cases, and our reporting is good. We're reporting every death. In fact, I see, this morning, where New York added 3,000 deaths because they died. And they're now saying — rather than, “It was a heart attack” — they're saying, “It was a heart attack caused by this.” So they're adding. If you look at it, that's it."
3782,2020-04-05,"And everything we have is documented, reported. And what they are doing is, just in case, they're calling it this. And that's okay. That's okay. But we are — we have more cases because we do more reporting. We have more cases because everything is down."
3783,2020-04-05,"But does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries that you've been watching and you've been reporting on? And then, it's like they didn't have the big thing. They have been some really, really bad — heavily — and really, some countries that are in big, big trouble. And they're not reporting the facts. And that's up to them."
3784,2020-04-05,"All I know is: We report the facts, and we're a country that's getting better."
3785,2020-04-05,"John, go ahead."
3786,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't want to say that, John. But I will tell you, more and more, we're hearing the story. And we'll see. When you say “multiple sources” — now there's a case where you can use the word “sources” — but we are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation that happened."
3787,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
3788,2020-04-05,I don't want to discuss what I talked to him about the laboratory. I just don't want to discuss it. It's inappropriate right now.
3789,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead, in the back."
3790,2020-04-05,"Look, I feel very badly about the World Health Organization, but it's been a tool of China. It's been, as I say, totally China-centric. You take a look at everything that's happened; they've been wrong. I was all for it at the beginning. What do I know? I walked in, I said, “World Health Organization — isn't that wonderful?” And then you start to see all the mistakes. They didn't want us to close our borders to China — to Wuhan, specifically. They didn't want our borders closed."
3791,2020-04-05,"You take a look — Mike was there; we were all there — and they're criticizing me for closing the border. I did that very early. By the way, I did that very early, while Nancy Pelosi was trying to have, in San Francisco, parties in Chinatown. Because they — she thought it would be great. She wanted to show that this thing doesn't exist. These are people — I'll tell you, we have some politicians on the other side that don't know what they're doing."
3792,2020-04-05,"If you look at — if you look at timelines — you've got to look at some timelines. But the World — the World Health Organization, just like the World Trade Organization — I'm telling you — I call them — they have been treating the United States, for decades, so badly. And they've been so in favor of China."
3793,2020-04-05,"China took off when it joined the World Trade Organization because of what's happened. Think of it: They're considered a developing nation. And because they're a dev- — and we're not. But we're a developing nation too, in my book. Okay? We're developing too."
3794,2020-04-05,"But the fact is: We have been treated so badly by these organizations. And, believe me, I'm looking at that one too. We're winning a lot of lawsuits right now that we never won before in the past. We're winning a lot of money that we never won in the past. That's with the World Trade. But with the World Health Organization — what's happened there is a disgrace."
3795,2020-04-05,"Here's the other thing: We pay $400- to $500 million a year. China is paying $38-, $39-, and $40 million a year. And it's like they control this group. I could do that too, if I want to devote full time to it. I have some very capable people dealing with Dr. Tedros. Okay? I could do it too. I could do very well with that. But there's something going on. There's something going on that is very bad."
3796,2020-04-05,"Now, the $500 million that we save, we'll determine — we're going to make a determination over a little period of time. But they're going to either have to make massive changes — I don't even know if they're going to be able to do that — or we're going to give money to people. We want to help people. You know, what we do in Africa with AIDS — people have no idea what we do and the money we spent. We were talking about it the other day, Doctor."
3797,2020-04-05,"We are spending billions of dollars to help people. In the case of one that Dr. Birx is very much involved in, AIDS — billions of dollars. And you know what? It's a great thing. Nobody talks about it. Nobody gives us credit. We do that, and we do it very directly."
3798,2020-04-05,"But we're spending billions of dollars to help people live and — all over the world. But we're spending $500 million to the World Health Organization, and there's something very bad going on. And you know what? I've gotten very much involved. It's been going on for a long period of time, and we don't want to be the suckers anymore."
3799,2020-04-05,"So, it's cold out. We will talk to you tomorrow. A big day tomorrow. Very big day. Thank you."
3800,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, everyone. My administration will do everything possible to help those communities get back on their feet. We're speaking with the governors and representatives. FEMA is already on its way, and they got there — as soon as we heard the word, I said, “Get out there.” So FEMA is there, and you know the great job that FEMA does. It's, really, something very special."
3801,2020-04-05,"So we just want to say: Warmest condolences, and we're with you all the way. It's a tough deal. That was a bad, bed level five. That was a bad group. That's as high as it gets. It was a bad grouping of tornadoes. Something that's something incredible, the power — the horrible, destructive power."
3802,2020-04-05,"America is continuing to make critical progress in our war against the virus. Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat nationwide. Flat. Hospitalizations are slowing in hotspots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan, and Louisiana. This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines. It's been incredible what they've done."
3803,2020-04-05,"You looked at the charts, and the charts are — and the models from early on — predictions were 100 [thousand] and 120,000 people look like. If they did well, they were going to unfortunately perish. And we're going to be, hopefully, way, way below that number. So that will be a sign of people doing things right, but it's still just a horrible thing all over the world. A hundred and eighty-four countries."
3804,2020-04-05,"This is all a tribute to our wonderful healthcare advisors and experts who have been with us right from the beginning. We appreciate it so much. In fact, Dr. Fauci is here. Maybe I could ask Tony to say a few words before we go any further."
3805,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Tony, please."
3806,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, the travel ban, that was earlier. The travel ban was done earlier."
3807,2020-04-05,"And if you look at statistics — I happened to write a couple of them down. If you look at statistics — so, on January 6th — that's long before the dates you're talking about — there were — CDC issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China, a notice, before there was even a confirmed case of the virus in the United States. That's on January 6th. This is all documented. Because we have so much fake news, I like to document things. January 6th, long before the dates we're talking about, CDC issued travel notice to Wuhan — for Wuhan."
3808,2020-04-05,"On January 11th, we have zero cases in the United States. Zero. We don't have any cases. So there are no cases reported that we know of. This is January 11th. The CDC issued a level one travel notice health — for health, while there were still no confirmed cases. So we had zero cases. People want me to act. I'm supposed to close down the economy — the greatest economy in the history of the world — and we don't have one case confirmed in the United States. That's January 11th."
3809,2020-04-05,"On January 17th, the CDC began implementing public health entry screenings at three major U.S. airports that received the greatest volume of passengers from Wuhan, at my instructions. There was not a single case of the coronavirus in the United States. So on January 17th, there wasn't a case, and the fake news is saying, “Oh, he didn't act fast enough.” Well, you remember what happened. Because when I did act, I was criticized by Nancy Pelosi, by Sleepy Joe Biden. I was criticized by everybody. In fact, I was called xenophobic. I was asking Biden to please define that for me. I was called other things by Democrats and some others — not too many others, actually. So that — by the media, definitely."
3810,2020-04-05,"Now, on January 21st — this is long before the time we're talking, because when Tony is talking, I believe he's talking about the end of February. On January 21st, okay — still early — there was one case of the virus. At that time, we called it the “Wuhan virus,” right? Wuhan. There was one case in the whole United States. We have one case. This is all documented. It all comes from you. A lot of it comes from you people."
3811,2020-04-05,"On January 21st, the CDC activated an emergency operation center. There was just one case, one person. That's why that ad was such a phony. There was one person in the United States. You know they used the ad, “There's only one person...” That statement was made at that time. One case. In the whole United States, one case. I'm supposed to shut down the government? The biggest — the biggest economy in the history of the world. “Shut it down. We have one case.”"
3812,2020-04-05,"Seven cases were on January 31st. Now, on January 21st, there was a case. Not one person had died. You heard that, Steve, right? Not one person."
3813,2020-04-05,"So we have this massive country, the United States of America. We have the greatest economy in the world — bigger than China's, by a lot — right? — because of what we've done over the last three and a half years, prior to the virus, but including the virus. So we have the biggest economy, the greatest economy we've ever had; the highest employment numbers; the best employment numbers; best unemployment numbers also. The best of everything."
3814,2020-04-05,"So, on January 31st — think of it — not one person has died. Not one. Nobody died. Not one, Jon. I don't think you'll find any. This is reported by CDC, confirmed by the news — which doesn't mean anything to me because they don't tell the truth. But CDC reported: January 31st, not one person has died. And I issued a travel restriction from China. Think of it. So nobody died, and I issued. You can't get earlier than that."
3815,2020-04-05,"So we have nobody died, and I said, “China, you can't come in. I'm sorry.” Because I saw what was going on. It wasn't so much what I was told; it was that I saw what was going on and I didn't like it. But I didn't speak to Tony about it. Didn't speak to very many people about it. I didn't like it."
3816,2020-04-05,"So what did I do? Ready? January 31st: In the United States, not one person had died because of the — again, the Wuhan virus. So I issued travel restrictions on that date, even though nobody died, and I got brutalized over it by the press because I was way too early; I shouldn't have done it. Brutalized by the press. But, you know, sort of — I've been brutalized for the last four years. I used to do well before I decided to run for politics. But I guess I'm doing okay because, to the best of my knowledge, I'm the President of the United States, despite the things that are said."
3817,2020-04-05,"So, then, first mandatory quarantine in more than 50 years, we did. First mandatory in 50 years. The same restrictions that the Democrats and the media called “xenophobic.” Now, Joe Biden said, “He's a racist.” He called me a racist because I said, “We're shutting down entry from China. We're shutting it down.” He called me xenophobic, and he called me racist and other things."
3818,2020-04-05,"Since then, on a Friday night, two weeks ago, Joe Biden issued a state- — it wasn't him; he didn't write it. I'm sure he doesn't even know that it was issued. But the people from his campaign — who are smart. The people that write those little PR releases are pretty smart, reasonably good. Not the best, but they're not bad. But they issued a statement, saying that Joe Biden agrees that the Pres- — that President Trump was right to close it down to China. Now, he did that."
3819,2020-04-05,"Now, he issued it on Friday night. We've all heard about that, Jon — Friday nights, right? In fact, his was later Friday night than I ever released mine on Friday night. Okay?"
3820,2020-04-05,"So he did — he did it pretty late. I mean, you know, like at 11 o'clock in the evening or something. You know, that's pretty late. Anyway. So Joe Biden issued — and it's one of those things."
3821,2020-04-05,"But, in February, Nancy Pelosi said we should come to Chinatown. This is late February. “Come to Chinatown. We think it's very safe. Come here. Let's all have the big parade — Chinatown parade.” Probably referring to San Francisco. And that's it."
3822,2020-04-05,"But I took this action early. And so the story in the New York Times was a total fake. It's a fake newspaper and they write fake stories. And someday — hopefully in five years, when I'm not here — those papers are all going out of business because nobody is going to want to read them. But now they like them because they write about me."
3823,2020-04-05,"Now, with that, I have a couple of interesting — we have a few clips that we're just going to put up. We could turn the lights a little bit lower. I think you'll find them interesting. And then we'll answer some questions. I'll ask you some questions because you're so guilty, but forget it. But most importantly, we're going to get back onto the reason we're here, which is the success we're having. Okay?"
3824,2020-04-05,"Please, you could put it on. Thank you."
3825,2020-04-05,"So we could give you hundreds of clips like that from governors — including Democratic or “Democrat,” as I call them, governors, which is actually the correct term. We could give you hundreds of clips just like that. We have them. We didn't want this to go on too long, but I just want to say it's — you know, it's very sad when people write false stories like, in that case, I guess it was gotten mostly from the New York Times, which is a highly — I mean, if you had libel laws, they would have been out of business even before they'll end up going out of business. So it's too bad."
3826,2020-04-05,"But we could have given you — you saw the statements. We have hundreds of statements. Hundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors."
3827,2020-04-05,"And if you look, they were all saying, “We need ventilators. We need...” You don't hear “ventilators” anymore. They have all the ventilators they need, which we were right about. We said, “You're asking for too many. You don't need that.” And, in all fairness, these two people right here — Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci — they said, “I don't think they need that many ventilators.” And I said, “I agree.”"
3828,2020-04-05,"At one point — and I'm not knocking New York for this, but they were asking — you remember? — 40,000 ventilators. And that's more than they have all over the country. And we got them a lot of ventilators, and nobody has complained."
3829,2020-04-05,"We got them, as you know, beautiful — we built hospital rooms all over the country. The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, was very nice. He said, “You know what? You don't have to build a second hospital.” Because good news is happening. They're not able to fill the beds. They needed two hospitals. We built one; it was perfect. We're getting — we're just starting the other. I called him up. I said, “Do you think we should build the second one? I don't think you're going to need it.” He said, “Let me get back.” He got back. We didn't need it."
3830,2020-04-05,"With Governor Cuomo, in all good spirit and faith, he wanted to have the Jacob Javits Center done. And we built 2,900 incredible beds. Incredible. Then we make it — we made it COVID — and — or, to be exactly accurate, COVID-19, and — which was a lot of work. We had to change the ductwork. We had to seal up certain areas. We had to put areas of rooftop things over the beds. We did a lot of work. And we had it — but they never really had too much use for it."
3831,2020-04-05,"And they called also — Mayor de Blasio, rightfully, he called. He said, “Would it be possible to get more medical help?” So, now, not only are we building facilities, we're — they're asking us for help because they're unable to man it. And we got him the help. We got Mayor de Blasio a lot of help."
3832,2020-04-05,"Then, when the Javits Center wasn't used much — and then, as you know, the Mercy — and we took the Mercy and we took the Comfort, and we made them both — Los Angeles and New York — we made them COVID-adaptable, which was not easy to do. And we didn't get almost any people sent there. They didn't need them at the beginning because they didn't need it for anything but this because there were fewer accidents, fewer motorcycles, fewer everything."
3833,2020-04-05,"And what we did was like an incredible job, but they didn't need them. It turned out — they were there. We were ready. You know the expression? They have an expression: “Ready, willing, and able.” We were ready, willing, and able. What the Army Corps of Engineers did was a miracle. What — what FEMA did was a miracle. What the doctors did."
3834,2020-04-05,"So I got a call two days ago from the mayor of New York. He said, “Could you help us even more with medical personnel?” And we sent — I think it was 448 doctors, nurses, and respiratory experts. Real experts. And I got a call from the mayor and he said, “I want to tell you: Incredible — these people are incredible.” He said, “They lifted the spirits of the hospital workers from New York City like nothing I've ever seen.” He's — he was unbelievable, what he said. It was really appreciated. And I let them know that. I let the military people — he said, “They went in there so brave, so incredible. They lifted the spirits of everybody.”"
3835,2020-04-05,"We did all of this work, but when you read the phony stories, you — nobody — nobody acknowledges this. And it doesn't have to be acknowledged, from my standpoint, but it does have to be acknowledged from the great work that these doctors, nurses, the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA — all these people, they've done this incredible job. And they shouldn't be abused because — you take a look at what's happened. Nobody is asking for ventilators, except outside of our country."
3836,2020-04-05,"Outside of our country, they're calling me — every country. They're calling me. So many countries. And I'm going to try and help them because we have thousands of ventilators being built. But nobody is asking for ventilators. Nobody is asking for beds because we built hospitals. I think we built 20,000 beds in a period of a couple of weeks."
3837,2020-04-05,"The job they've done is incredible. With all of that being said, I'm getting along very well with governors. And if I wouldn't, Mike Pence had a call today with the governors and it was like a 10. I said, “How was it?” He said, “It's a 10.” He was one of my expressions, actually. But he said it was like a 10."
3838,2020-04-05,"And I'm sure you people were probably on the call, although you weren't supposed to be. But you were sitting in somebody's office listening to it, because every time we have these — and, you know, and you would know that for weeks those calls have been very good. But there wasn't a raised voice. There wasn't even a statement of like, “We think you should do this or that.” I heard it was, like, just a perfect phone call. It might not be reported that way. They'll say, “I thought that somebody maybe slightly raised...” Didn't even raise a voice."
3839,2020-04-05,"My only point of saying this, because I want to get back to why we're here: The press has not treated these incredible people who've done such a great job, they haven't treated them fairly. They're way off. We were way ahead of schedule."
3840,2020-04-05,"And remember this — because the Times story was a fake — but everything — remember this: Everything we did, I was criticized because I was too early. If I waited longer, it would have been — you would have been critic- — if I went way early, if I went three months earlier, I would have been criticized — you know, criticized for being way too early."
3841,2020-04-05,"So, with all of that being said, we understand it. I think I've educated a lot of people as to the press. And I would love to be able to say that we have a very honest press. Honestly, Jon, there'd be nothing I would be more proud of if the press would work — and I don't mind being criticized, but not when they're wrong. Not when people have done a great job."
3842,2020-04-05,Yes.
3843,2020-04-05,"That was done by a group in the office, and it was done just by — we just put some clips together. I could give you — I'll bet you I have over 100 more clips even better than them. They were just pieced together over the last two hours. That was just — oh, we have far better than that. That's nothing compared to some of them."
3844,2020-04-05,"Yeah, this was done by Dan and a group of people, and they just put it together in a period of probably less than two hours."
3845,2020-04-05,"Because we're getting fake news, and I like to have it corrected. They're saying what a great job we're doing, and the media — these are the governors of California, governor of New Jersey, governor of New York."
3846,2020-04-05,"Look, in New York, we work very close with Andrew. In New York, ventilators — we're going to be probably — we didn't — they didn't have a problem. We got them tremendous numbers of — thousands, but we got them a tremendous number of ventilator. You don't hear ventilators are a problem. Beds were going to be a problem. I mean, I'm happy about it. The Javits Center, which is incredible, is almost empty because they don't need them. That's good news, not bad news. I'm — you know, I'm not saying, “Gee, I wish more people were there.” I don't want more people there."
3847,2020-04-05,"We brought in the boat. We brought in the Comfort. And the Comfort was originally not supposed to be for this at all — the coronavirus. It was not supposed to be for that at all. They called, they said, “Could we have it?” That was a number of weeks ago. We said, “We don't think you need it, but if you need it, we'll do it.” Then they said, “Could you get the medical personnel to run the Javits Center? Could you get the medical personnel to run the ship?” We said, “If it's necessary, we will.” And we did. There were military personnel. That's the ones that Mayor de Blasio was so great to, in terms of his statements. I mean, I really appreciated his statements. He was so impressed with them, and I am too. The level of genius and bravery. They're great people, the military people."
3848,2020-04-05,And we pieced that together — I would say it took less than two hours. It was done in house.
3849,2020-04-05,Steve?
3850,2020-04-05,"I wouldn't use the word “produced.” All they did was took some clips, and they just ran them for you. And the reason they did is to keep you honest. Now, I don't think that's going to work. It's not going to have any impact. But just think of it: You heard the clips, you heard what I said. They said I acted late on closing down the country."
3851,2020-04-05,"Some people wish we never closed it down. Now, if we didn't, we would have lost hundreds of thousands of people. You know, interestingly — so I'm — I'm against that. We did the right thing. Everything we did was right. If we would have closed down —"
3852,2020-04-05,"Well — well, look, governors should have had ventilators; they chose not to have them. We were able to get them ventilators. You haven't heard — other than, you know, there was a lot of panic, a lot of screaming, “We want ventilators.” They got the ventilators. You don't have that anymore. And the surge is supposed to be coming now. And if they do need ventilators, Jon, we've got almost 10,000 that are ready to rock. We have people standing with those ventilators right now. If you needed 2,000 in New York, which you don't, but if you did, we can have them here in less than 24 hours. We're ready to rock. This was a great — this was a great military — and beyond that — operation."
3853,2020-04-05,"Let's get back to the regular. Shouldn't we get back to the regular? We could talk about this, but all I'm doing is this: I could have given you — like, those are four or five clips that we just played for you. I could have given you hundreds of people — I mean, Gavin was on television two days ago with one of your competitors, singing praises. He says, “Look...” You know, the question was asked in a negative way. He said, “Look, I know what you want to say but — want me to say, but he's been really good. It's hard for me to say that. In fact, it's impossible for me to say it.” Gavin Newsom, the governor of California."
3854,2020-04-05,"I have many clips from many — I have some clips from Anthony, that I didn't want to put up, which were really good. I think Anthony would be the first one to say, when I closed the country to China, when I closed the — the China ban, whatever you want to call it — Anthony said I saved a lot of lives by doing that. I mean, am I correct? I don't want to put words in Anthony's mouth, by the way, and I like him."
3855,2020-04-05,"Today, I walk in and I hear I'm going to fire him. I'm not firing — I think he's a wonderful guy."
3856,2020-04-05,I retweeted somebody. I don't know. They said “fire.” It doesn't matter.
3857,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I notice everything."
3858,2020-04-05,"No, no, that's somebody's opinion. All that is is an opinion."
3859,2020-04-05,"No, I was called about that. I said, “I'm not firing him.” In fact, if you ask your friends in the office — in the public relations office, I was immediately called upon that. And I said, “No, I like him. I think he's terrific.” Because this was a person's view. Not everybody is happy with Anthony. Not everybody is happy with everybody."
3860,2020-04-05,"But I will tell you, we have done a job, the likes of which nobody has ever done. The mobilization, getting of equipment, all of the things we've done — nobody has ever done a job like this."
3861,2020-04-05,"We have 50 governors — and territories, by the way. People don't ever mention that we have territories. We have 50 governors and territories, and many of those governors are Democrats, and they can't find anything to complain about. And honestly, many of them didn't do their jobs. I'll let you know someday — let's see what happens — but I may let you know who's not doing their job. I can tell you the ones that are good, both Republican and Democrat, and the ones who don't know what they're doing. But we help some of the ones that don't know what they're doing. They should have had their own stockpiles. And now, if they want, we can build them stockpiles of ventilators."
3862,2020-04-05,"The hardest thing is a ventilator, because it's expensive, it takes a while to get. We got them, and nobody believed we did."
3863,2020-04-05,"Now, many of the governors were asking for far too many. And we said they were asking for far too many. We talked and we said — you said very strongly that they just don't need that many. You said they don't need that many beds — Deborah."
3864,2020-04-05,"So that's it. Steve, go ahead."
3865,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we have been from the beginning. I don't know what it is exactly. But if I put somebody's opinion up — you know, I don't mind controversy. I think controversy is a good thing, not a bad thing. But I want it to be honest controversy."
3866,2020-04-05,"Now, when I got a call — I got a call not very quickly; nobody, you know, saw that as being any big deal — they said, “How are you doing with Dr. Fauci?” I said, “I'm doing great.” And I didn't talk to Dr. Fauci, even until we just got here. Dr. Fauci asked one of the people if he could get up and speak, and he did."
3867,2020-04-05,And they totally misinterpreted him. I saw what they did.
3868,2020-04-05,"Here's the thing. No, no. What he really is saying though: “But how could you have done it?” Look, I just went over stats with you. Right here. Right here."
3869,2020-04-05,"How do you close it up? You have no deaths and no cases on January 11th. Doctor, would you recommend closing the United States of America?” “Oh, this must be terrible. How many cases do we have?” “None.” How many deaths do we have?” “None.”"
3870,2020-04-05,"January 17th — go back another week. On January 17th — this is 10 days before I did the — little bit less than 10 days before I did the ban. I did a ban on China. You think that was easy? I then did a ban on Europe. And a lot of people said that was an incredible thing to do, because you look at Spain — and, by the way, we're doing very well because when you look at all of those flat graphs and you add it all up, the United States is very low, and per capita we're very low. We're doing very well."
3871,2020-04-05,"But how do you close up the United States of America? So, on January 6th, no deaths. On January 11th, no deaths. And no — no cases. On January 17th, no cases, no cases, no deaths. I'm supposed to close up the United States of America when I have no cases?"
3872,2020-04-05,I closed down from China.
3873,2020-04-05,"Excuse me, I closed it down from China. And, by the way, some people think I should have waited longer and maybe ridden it out. I disagree with them. Okay? But it was thought of. I mean, that was an alternative. You know, there are a lot of people that would have said, “Let's ride it out.” Now, I'll give you the good news. If I would have done that, it would have been, I think, catastrophic because their numbers are, Anthony, 1.6 to 2.2 million people would have died if we tried to do that."
3874,2020-04-05,"And I did this last time: Cut it in half. Don't say 2.2 million. Cut it in more than half. Say a million people died — well, that's much more than the Civil War. Cut it in half. Take the million and cut it in half; that's 500,000 people would have died. Now, that number we would have reached. Okay? That would have been easy to reach if we did nothing. So we did the right thing, and our timing was very good."
3875,2020-04-05,"But here's the one thing — and you have to say this — when you ask me, “Why didn't you do this?” — how come when I did the ban on China and some very, very — instituted some very tough things, how come Nancy Pelosi, a month later, is in Chinatown, saying, “Let's all march. This is not going to happen”? How come we have many of the experts from CNN and many other networks — if you call CNN a network; I don't, personally. But we have CNN, we have many other places, and they're all saying, “He doesn't need to do it. He doesn't need to do it.”"
3876,2020-04-05,"All I'm saying is this: How do you close down the greatest economy in the history of the world when, on January 17th, you have no cases and no death; when on January 21st, you have one case and no death? One case. Think of it. Now, we're supposed to close down the country?"
3877,2020-04-05,"But here's what happened: When, on January 31st, I instituted the ban, Joe Biden went crazy. He said, “You don't need the ban. You...” He didn't go crazy. Like, he has — he didn't even know what the hell the ban was. But he — so he didn't go crazy. But he did say —"
3878,2020-04-05,He did call me xenophobic.
3879,2020-04-05,"Wait a minute. He called me xenophobic; he called me a racist because — he has since apologized and he said I did the right thing. So when you say, “Why didn't you do this?” Every Democrat thought I made a mistake when I did it. I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives, by doing that."
3880,2020-04-05,You're so — you're so —
3881,2020-04-05,You're so disgraceful. It's so disgraceful the way you say that.
3882,2020-04-05,Let me just — listen.
3883,2020-04-05,I just went over it.
3884,2020-04-05,I just went over it.
3885,2020-04-05,Nobody thought we should do it. And when I did it —
3886,2020-04-05,You know what we did?
3887,2020-04-05,You know what we did?
3888,2020-04-05,What do you do — what do you do when you have no case in the whole United States when you —
3889,2020-04-05,"Excuse me. You reported it: zero cases, zero deaths on January 17th."
3890,2020-04-05,January. I said in January.
3891,2020-04-05,On January 30th —
3892,2020-04-05,A lot.
3893,2020-04-05,"A lot. And, in fact, we'll give you a list — what we did. In fact, part of it was up there. We did a lot."
3894,2020-04-05,"Look. Look, you know you're a fake. You know that. Your whole network — the way you cover it — is fake. And most of you — and not all of you — but the people are wise to you. That's why you have a lower — a lower approval rating than you've ever had before, times probably three."
3895,2020-04-05,And when you ask me that questions —
3896,2020-04-05,Let me ask you this: Why didn't Biden — why did Biden apologize? Why did he write a letter of apology?
3897,2020-04-05,Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly? You know why? Because they really thought that I acted too quickly. We have done a great job.
3898,2020-04-05,"Now, I could've — I could've kept it open. And I could've done what some countries are doing. They're getting beat up pretty badly. I could have kept it open. I thought of keeping it open because nobody has ever heard of closing down a country, let alone the United States of America. But if I would have done that, we would have had hundreds of thousands of people that would right now be dead."
3899,2020-04-05,We've done this right. And we really — we really have done this right. The problem is the press doesn't cover it the way it should be.
3900,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. One more question. Steve, go ahead."
3901,2020-04-05,"Well, I have the ultimate authority, but we're going to get into that in a minute. We're going to just finish this up. We're going to tell you about other things that we've done right."
3902,2020-04-05,"But I will say this: Had we said, “Let's just keep going and let's not do a closing” — whether it's 2.2 that they, at one point, predicted as an outside or 1.6 at a lower number; you cut it all the way down to 6- or 7- or 800,000; take just a fraction of the number that could have happened, it literally would have been more than the Civil War. It would have been a disaster."
3903,2020-04-05,"So, the minimum number was 100,000. And I think — I feel pretty good that we're going to be substantially below, Anthony, the 100,000. And I hope we will."
3904,2020-04-05,"All right. So, today, the Department of Health and Human Services is announcing five new contracts to procure large numbers of additional ventilators under the Defense Production Act, which we used a lot, by the way — which you didn't like to talk about — in addition to the 1,300 we received today. We received, today, 1,300 additional ventilators. Now, we're probably not going to need them, but we can add that to our stockpile, which is very big, and we can move it around should the surge take place and should it be a very substantial surge. We're ready to — we're ready to rock."
3905,2020-04-05,"The contracts are with General Electric, Hillrom, Medtronic, ResMed, and Vyaire, combined with the DPA contracts that we announced last week with General Motors and Philips and two other contracts with Hamilton and ZOLL. We're adding 6,190 ventilators to the Strategic National Stockpile, of which we have a lot already — thousands — close to 10,000. But this will be added by May 8th, another 29,000 by the end of May. And more than 120,000 total we will have by the end of the year."
3906,2020-04-05,"Now, we're going to help other countries. We're going to help states if they need it. We may help some states' stockpile. You know, they're supposed to buy their own stockpile. They have state stockpiles. They're supposed to be using that. And unfortunately, most of the states weren't there. And a lot of people didn't want to talk about it, but they weren't there. We will talk about it at the right time, if you want to. I — at this point, I'm more focused on getting past this nightmare of a epidemic or a pandemic — anything you want to call it. We got to get past it."
3907,2020-04-05,"No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. Think of that. You know, you heard all about ventilators, ventilators. “We need ventilators.” Because they didn't have them. Because the states should have had them. No one who has needed a ventilator has not gotten a ventilator. No one who has needed a hospital bed has been denied a hospital bed. That's not even really our responsibility."
3908,2020-04-05,"Now, if we can help, we're going to do it. But that's where the Army Corps of Engineers did such a great job. We built over 20,000 beds. In fact, we built thousands more than we've actually needed to be safe. We wanted to be safe and we really — they rose to this incredible occasion."
3909,2020-04-05,"I mean, we built more beds than we thought. We thought, in Louisiana, we were going heavy. And again, when I called the governor, I said, “Maybe we shouldn't build that second hospital, because we don't want to build it if you don't need it.” He called back, he said, “I don't think we're going to need it.” They had 1,000 rooms, 1,000 beds, and they used a lot of them, but they didn't need the other one so we stopped it because we don't want to waste."
3910,2020-04-05,"But we're prepared to build thousands more should we need it. I don't think we're going to need it because it looks like we're plateauing and maybe even, in many cases, coming down."
3911,2020-04-05,"In addition, we've ordered a total of 60 mobile decontamidation [sic] — -contamination systems. So the decontamination system from Battelle, in Ohio, is an incredible thing because it takes the masks, and up to 20 times you can decontaminate a mask. And I've been asking from the beginning: “Why can't we sterilize and sanitize these masks?” And it turned out we can. And there was a great company in Ohio, they sent us some great equipment, and they're doing that now."
3912,2020-04-05,"And now we're going to have more than 33 million N95 masks per week will be cleaned, decontaminated, and it'll be great. It's something that, frankly, I think people should have thought of a long time ago."
3913,2020-04-05,"Five more flights landed today as part of the Project Air Bridge — our massive air lift operation to bring personal protective equipment into the United States, which has now delivered nearly half a million N95 masks, 370 million gloves, 25 million surgical masks, and 4.9 million gowns. So, we have millions of gowns, gloves, masks, all surgical equipment coming in should the states need it."
3914,2020-04-05,"Now, the states — the states are supposed to be buying their own stuff. But should they need it, we are ready to give them, because we're building up our stockpile again like crazy."
3915,2020-04-05,"Remember, I — and you saw the stories. I inherited — this administration — Mike, myself, the whole administration, we inherited a stockpile where the cupboards were bare. There was nothing. And I say it and I'll say it again: Just like we didn't have ammunition, we didn't have medical supplies, we didn't have ventilators, we didn't have a lot of things that should have been had. And you can read your own stories on that because you know what happened: They didn't want to spend the money. But we did."
3916,2020-04-05,"To date, we've facilitated the supply of more than 38 million N95 masks nationwide. This week, we'll be sending 2 million N95 masks to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Vice President will go into more detail. He's got great detail on that, and I think it's a pretty amazing story. We have a lot of masks already in stock, and we have more coming."
3917,2020-04-05,"We're further expanding hospital surge capacity in key areas of the opening, and we have a portion of certain VA hospitals and non-veteran coronavirus patients, including at the East Orange, New Jersey Medical Center, as well as facilities in Manhattan and Brooklyn. They're ready. They're able. They're beautiful. Hopefully, we won't need too many of them because, frankly, we built everything that the governors wanted. And in many cases, it's too much. We told them it was too much, but we wanted to err on the side of caution."
3918,2020-04-05,"The United States has now conducted nearly 3 million tests for the virus. Three million — the most of any nation. We are performing approximately 150,000 tests every single day and our rate of testing is especially high in areas hardest hit by the virus, if you look. And that's really — and it has hit some areas — the virus — very, very hard. For example, per capita testing in New York is higher than the rest of the world."
3919,2020-04-05,"The NIH, CDC, and FDA are also currently validating several antibody tests that will allow us to determine whether someone has already had the virus and potentially become immune to infection. We're looking at that. The antibody tests are going to be very interesting, over the next short while. A lot of things are being developed, as we speak."
3920,2020-04-05,"In the race to develop effective treatments, the drug company Gilead announced that its drug, remdesivir, has shown promising results — very promising — in compassionate use settings. In addition, the FDA has just granted emergency use authorization for a device that removes certain proteins from the bloodstream, possibly preventing a patient's immune system from overreacting to the virus and damaging vital organs, which is a big problem."
3921,2020-04-05,"Furthermore, over the last seven days, my administration has deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from our National Stockpile. We have millions of doses that we bought and many people are using it all over the country. And just recently, a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that — that drug. So, who knows? And you combine it with Z-Pak, you combine it with Zinc — depending on your doctor's recommendation. And it's having some very good results, I'll tell you."
3922,2020-04-05,"I think if anybody recommended it other than me, it would be used all over the place, to be honest with you. I think the fact that I recommended it, I probably set it back a lot. But it's a lot of good things that are happening with it. A lot of good tests."
3923,2020-04-05,"Scientists are also pursuing a blood therapy known as convalescent plasma. Convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to treat those who are sick. And this is something that actually is a very old procedure, but it's done in a very modern way."
3924,2020-04-05,"During this difficult time, we're also working to ensure that the 2020 Census is completed safely and accuracy. We may be asking for an extension because, obviously, they can't be doing very much right now. They wouldn't even be allowed to do it. So, the Census, we're going to be asking for a delay — a major delay, I think. How can you possibly be knocking on doors for a long period of time now?"
3925,2020-04-05,"The Census Bureau recently made the decision to temporarily suspend its field operation data-collection activities to help stop the spread. In addition, while millions of Americans continue to complete their questionnaire online, the Census Bureau has asked Congress for a 120 extension. I don't know that you even have to ask them. This is called “an act of God.” This is called a — a situation that has to be — they have to give in. I think 120 days isn't nearly enough."
3926,2020-04-05,"My administration is also taking bold action to help American workers. On Friday, Americans began receiving the cash payments authorized by a historic $2 trillion relief bill."
3927,2020-04-05,"By the end of the week, nearly 80 million Americans will receive a total of $147 billion. And from what the Secretary of the Treasury tells me, that's very much on time and going very nicely. He'll be speaking in a moment. And payments — these payments go directly into the banks and the bank accounts of these people. Millions of additional payments will follow. The typical family of four will receive $3,400. That's for a family of four. That's something."
3928,2020-04-05,"Additionally, through our Paycheck Protection Program –which is a tremendous success, and they should extend it and increase it. This has been a tremendous success. So successful that the banks are taking a little bit longer to distribute the money, but it's going rapidly."
3929,2020-04-05,We've now processed over $200 billion in loans to help small businesses retain their workers. Now we urgently need lawmakers to set aside the partisan agendas and to replenish this program with new funds because it's really something that has been an incredible success. And they need more money to keep it going to take care of these business and keep them — keep them open.
3930,2020-04-05,"I want to thank the many governors, health professionals, scientists, and business leaders for their incredible hard work and input over the past month, and even long beyond a month, Mike, I would say. You know, we've been working together with a lot of for, it seems like, forever."
3931,2020-04-05,"I've been having many discussions with my team and top experts, and we're very close to completing a plan to open our country, hopefully even ahead of schedule. And that's so important."
3932,2020-04-05,"We will soon finalize new and very important guidelines to give governors the information they need to start safely opening their states. My administration's plan and corresponding guidelines will give the American people the confidence they need to begin returning to normal life. That's what we want. We want to have our country open. We want to return to normal life. Our country is going to be open, and it's going to be successfully opened. And we'll be explaining over a very short number of days exactly what is going to be."
3933,2020-04-05,"We've also, as you probably heard, developed a committee. We're actually calling it a number of committees with the most prominent people in the country, the most successful people in the various fields. And we'll be announcing them tomorrow."
3934,2020-04-05,"This weekend, the United States also helped facilitate an unprecedented agreement among the 23 nations of OPEC Plus — that's OPEC plus additional energy-producing nations — representing many of the world's largest oil-producing countries to stabilize oil markets. And we have, in fact — and I think you've seen a big stabilization over the last couple of days."
3935,2020-04-05,"Together, countries around the world will cut oil production by approximately 20 million barrels. People are saying 10 million, but we think that the number that they'll actually hit is going to be closer to 20 million barrels a day. And that will help a lot with saving jobs all over Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and many of other — other of our big energy states."
3936,2020-04-05,"This historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the U.S. oil and gas industry. It's a very monumental agreement. I want to thank Saudi Arabia and the King of Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia — both. I want to thank President Putin of Russia. And I want to thank a very good friend of mine — a man who's become a friend of mine: The President of Mexico showed great flexibility. President López Obrador. He showed great flexibility and — and tremendous intelligence doing what he did. It was not that easy for him. And I want to thank Mexico and the president. This is a very historic deal. Very historic. So we'll see how it all goes."
3937,2020-04-05,"In this time and challenge — and we are certainly in a time probably like we haven't been in many, many decades — we are strengthened and sustained by the bonds of love and loyalty that unite all Americans. I'm so proud of the American people."
3938,2020-04-05,"Everywhere you look, you see the patriotism of our people shining through and the courage of our doctors and nurses on the frontlines, and the dedication of our food supply workers, and in the commitment of every citizen to achieving victory over the virus. That's what's going to happen. It's going to happen sooner than people think. And we're going to be smart about it. Very, very smart about it. We're going to be safe about it. We're going to be listening also to the great doctors and medical professionals."
3939,2020-04-05,"Together, we're beating back the invisible enemy and we're paving the way for great resurgence. Really, a great resurgence for American prosperity. Our country wants to go back. They want to go back to work. They're going to go back safely, and that's what we want."
3940,2020-04-05,"I'd like now to ask Vice President Pence to say a few words, followed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. I think before we — before we do this — because I know there's an emergency where they want Steve to come. So what I'll do is I'll ask Steve to come up — Secretary of the Treasury. You can talk a little bit and then maybe take a couple of questions about what's happening. Tell them the success we're having."
3941,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
3942,2020-04-05,"You have any questions for Steve, please?"
3943,2020-04-05,Negotiation.
3944,2020-04-05,We have to do — everything has to be safe. We want safe.
3945,2020-04-05,"Well, I'll be doing that over the next few days because we'll probably be making a statement about that and exactly what it looks like."
3946,2020-04-05,"I know what that looks like, but I also want to get the advice, in a sense. We have some of the — the biggest from every business on this council. We're actually setting up a number of different councils or committees, I guess you could call them. And we have a lot of smart people. I think that they will give us some also good advice. But, no, we want to be very, very safe. At the same time, we got to get our country open."
3947,2020-04-05,"I do think so. Eventually, they will. Yeah."
3948,2020-04-05,"I think eventually they will do that. And I think we're going to — boom — I think we're going to — I think it's going to go quickly. Our people want to get back to work, and I think there's a pent-up demand like there hasn't been in a long time."
3949,2020-04-05,"And that's why — and that's why you see the stock market — I mean, to think that the stock market is at the level it is right now, with all that this world and this country has gone. And look at the European Union, how badly decimated they've been. Look at other countries. Look at China, by the way. I've seen the numbers. Look at China. Look at how these countries have been just decimated by this."
3950,2020-04-05,"And to think that the stock market is at this tremendously high number. Not that much — you know, it was looking a little bleak for a while, but it — it hit a certain point and then started going up. I think that's a great tribute to the fact that there's a demand."
3951,2020-04-05,Yeah.
3952,2020-04-05,Numerous provisions. We'll give you a legal brief if you want.
3953,2020-04-05,"Well, I think everybody wants to open. I mean, I guess, you know, that could happen, but I don't think that would happen."
3954,2020-04-05,Go ahead please.
3955,2020-04-05,"That's because I let that happen because I would have preferred that. I let that happen. But if I wanted to, I could have closed it up. But I let that happen and I like the way they've done it. And the seven that remained really in sort of a semi-lockdown — if you look at those states, they've really done a very good job. They're very much different from a New York or from other places where they've been hit very hard."
3956,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please. Yeah."
3957,2020-04-05,"Well, they can decide, but —"
3958,2020-04-05,"No, not at all. Let me just tell you — very simple. I'm going to put it very simply: The President of the United States has the authority to do what the President has the authority to do, which is very powerful. The President of the United States calls the shots."
3959,2020-04-05,"If we weren't here for the states, you would have had a problem in this country like you've never seen before. We were here to back them up. And we're backing — and we've more than backed them up. We did a job that nobody ever thought was possible. It's a decision for the President of the United States."
3960,2020-04-05,"Now, with that being said, we're going to work with the states because it's very important. You have local governments, they're pinpointed. It's really — you talk about — it's like a microchip. They are pinpointed. We have local government that hopefully will do a good job. And if they don't do a good job, I'd step in so fast. But no, they can't do anything without the approval of the President of the United States."
3961,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
3962,2020-04-05,"Well, if some states refuse to open, I would be — I would like to see that person run for election. They're going to open. They're going to all open."
3963,2020-04-05,"I think that's something that's not going to happen. They want to open. They have to open. They have to get open. Every one of those states, the people want to go and they want to —"
3964,2020-04-05,"Now, some will be — are in a different situation. You have — I won't name states now, but I will over the next two or three days. I'm going to be very specific. But you have some states where this is not the kind of a problem than it is in New York or Louisiana or Michigan or other places that got hit very hard. Illinois got hit very hard. But all states want to open and they want to open as soon as possible. But they want to open safely and so do I."
3965,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
3966,2020-04-05,"No, France got hit very hard. France got hit very hard. And again, he has to do what he has to do. He's a friend of mine. But France — Spain has just been decimated. You look at what's happened in Italy, it's a very well-known fact, what happened in Italy. No, they were hit very hard."
3967,2020-04-05,It's a group.
3968,2020-04-05,We've had very good dis- — really just good discussions.
3969,2020-04-05,"Steve, I just want to say we have had —"
3970,2020-04-05,"— discussions — wait, excuse me. One second, please. We've had very good discussions with the airlines. Very good discussions."
3971,2020-04-05,I don't want to say that. You'll be hearing over the next few days.
3972,2020-04-05,"And, Steve, do you want to talk about phase four?"
3973,2020-04-05,"This is — when somebody is the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that's the way it's got to be."
3974,2020-04-05,It's total. It's total.
3975,2020-04-05,And the governors know that.
3976,2020-04-05,"The governors know that. No, you have —"
3977,2020-04-05,— a couple of bands of — excuse me. Excuse me. You have a couple —
3978,2020-04-05,"You have a couple of bands of Democrat governors, but they will agree to it. They will agree to it."
3979,2020-04-05,"But the authority of the President of the United States, having to do with the subject we're talking about, is total."
3980,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please, go ahead."
3981,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
3982,2020-04-05,At the right time.
3983,2020-04-05,"And a very good question, actually."
3984,2020-04-05,"Well, I'm going to have to take a look. I wouldn't say Italy is doing great right now, and I wouldn't say Spain is doing great right now. And we just heard that France is extending its stay-inside order, right? Their stay — they've extended it — I just see that — and, I think, for a short period of time."
3985,2020-04-05,"But no, when they're back. We want to do it very quickly, but we want to make sure everything is good."
3986,2020-04-05,"No, right now we have a very —"
3987,2020-04-05,Right now we have a very strong ban. We're going to keep it that way until they heal.
3988,2020-04-05,"Well, I can't tell you that. I can't tell you that. I have to see: How are they doing? I mean, France just went for another two days — for another two weeks. We have to see."
3989,2020-04-05,Jon.
3990,2020-04-05,"Well, I'm not sure who — Jon, I'm not sure who really gave me advice on the ban. I think I took —"
3991,2020-04-05,I think I took my own advice on the ban. I don't know.
3992,2020-04-05,Okay.
3993,2020-04-05,I will and many other people also. But I will absolutely take their advice.
3994,2020-04-05,Please go ahead.
3995,2020-04-05,I don't think it would be likely because I think we're not very far from being on the same page.
3996,2020-04-05,Please.
3997,2020-04-05,"Well, they have to do it. Look, they're supposed to be doing it."
3998,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I know. I know."
3999,2020-04-05,"Well, they — they may need help, but —"
4000,2020-04-05,"But they're there. They're on ground. They've got local mayors, local representatives. They have people that do it."
4001,2020-04-05,"And what we did last time is unprecedented. We literally rebuilt tests. We — we rebuilt a whole industry because we inherited nothing. What we inherited from the previous administration was totally broken, which somebody should eventually say. Not only were the cupboards bare, as I say, but we inherited broken testing. Now we have great testing."
4002,2020-04-05,"I just left the top executives at Abbott. Who would have thought that would have happened, where they have such a great test as that?"
4003,2020-04-05,"And, in fact, what I'll do — I think, unless you have any further questions for the Secretary of the Treasury — do you have anybody for Steve? Anybody?"
4004,2020-04-05,Is that for the Secretary of the Treasury or for me?
4005,2020-04-05,"Because if it's for me, we can wait."
4006,2020-04-05,"We have to get him back to work, okay?"
4007,2020-04-05,"Well, we didn't want to do the Kennedy Center, just so you understand. And that that was done — the Democrats wanted it in. We didn't want that, but they wanted it in. And we had to agree in order to get something done for the workers. But we want this to be for the workers and for companies that employ the workers. That's what we're looking for. We're not looking for extraneous nonsense."
4008,2020-04-05,But are you talking about unemployment? You're talking about the unemployment?
4009,2020-04-05,"Sending it indirectly to the states? We would have preferred that it was sent directly to the people. The Democrats wanted it to be sent through the unemployment system. And, you know, I've talked to you about it: We have 40-year-old equipment in many of those systems. They're run by the state. But I'm hearing they're getting the money out anyway."
4010,2020-04-05,"Okay? Thank you, Steve."
4011,2020-04-05,"Phase four, Steve. Phase four. Come on, Steve."
4012,2020-04-05,"Okay. So you know what we're going to do? We're going to write up papers on this. It's not going to be necessary, because the governors need us one way or the other, because ultimately it comes with the federal government. That being said, we're getting along very well with the governors, and I feel very certain that there won't be a problem."
4013,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Go ahead."
4014,2020-04-05,I haven't asked anybody because I don't — you know why?
4015,2020-04-05,Because I don't have to.
4016,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
4017,2020-04-05,Enough. Please.
4018,2020-04-05,"It's nice of Governor Hogan, very much. We appreciate Governor Hogan's statement."
4019,2020-04-05,Cuomo.
4020,2020-04-05,Which one? What did he say?
4021,2020-04-05,"Well, they're looking at things in phase four, where they have — you know, where they talk about states, and they're also talking about hospitals. They're talking about states who have been battered, and they're also talking about hospitals. And we're certainly willing to look at that."
4022,2020-04-05,"You know, we'll see what we all come back with. But they are talking about states and they're talking about hospitals."
4023,2020-04-05,The sale of what?
4024,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't think that's going to happen. I think it's very extreme. But she's doing it, and I think it's going to be over a long way before we have to start thinking about it too much. It is strong. It's a very strong position to take. But they're making a lot of progress in Michigan, so let's see how it all works."
4025,2020-04-05,We're going to be talking about that very soon. I'm getting a full report. I'm not happy with the World Health Organization. I'm not happy with the World Trade Organization either. We've been ripped off by everybody.
4026,2020-04-05,"And we have — this country, for so many years, has been ripped off by everybody, whether it's a World Health or World Trade. And they're like — I call them the “Bobbsey Twins.” They'd look at our country — for years and years, we had people that did nothing about it. We're doing a lot about it. So we'll have a report."
4027,2020-04-05,"And we'll also — we're also talking about the World Trade Organization. But we've made a lot of progress there. We're now winning cases for the first time, because they know I'll leave if we don't get treated fairly."
4028,2020-04-05,"This country — our country — was at a point where we rarely, if ever, won the lawsuits within the World Trade Organization. But now we're winning a lot of them, because they know I'm not — I'm not playing games. We will pull out if we have to. We just won a 7-billion-dollar lawsuit, which was very nice."
4029,2020-04-05,"Uh, yeah. I would say, by the end of the week, I'm going to make a decision on that. Yeah. There's a lot of — right now, there's a lot of things happening."
4030,2020-04-05,How do you know there are no consequences?
4031,2020-04-05,How do you know there are no consequences?
4032,2020-04-05,I wouldn't tell you. China will find out. Why would I tell you?
4033,2020-04-05,"No, you started off by saying, “Why are there no consequences?”"
4034,2020-04-05,How do you know there are no consequences?
4035,2020-04-05,You're going to find out.
4036,2020-04-05,I wouldn't tell you. You'd probably be the last person on Earth I'd tell.
4037,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. Uh, yeah, please."
4038,2020-04-05,"Well, make no mistake about it: In the long history of this country, the authority of the President of the United States during national emergencies is unquestionably plenary. And you can look back through times of war and other national emergencies. And as the President said, we'll happily brief that."
4039,2020-04-05,"But in the days ahead, what the President has charged us to do is to work with our health experts. We're going to bring together an extraordinary group of American business leaders to counsel the President. And then, working with the CDC, we're going to produce new guidelines, based upon the data, for every state and territory in this nation. We're going to give them guidance. And, as the President has indicated, we'll continue to respect the leadership and partnership that we forge with every governor in America."
4040,2020-04-05,"But this is an unprecedented time. But I have to tell you: When you look at the fact — despite the heartbreaking loss of more than 22,000 Americans — when you look at the fact of what the health experts told us this could be, I think I only can feel a sense of gratitude to the American people, gratitude to the extraordinary team that has counseled this President, the steps that President Trump has taken, the policies that governors have implemented all across America."
4041,2020-04-05,"I mean, we were discussing today, at the task force, that when you look at the European Union as a whole, they have nearly three times the mortality rate that the United States of America has today. And that is a tribute to our extraordinary healthcare workers, their dedication, their tireless work. But it's also a tribute to the fact that the American people put into practice the mitigation efforts that the President counseled the nation to do on the advice of our best scientists, now more than a month ago, and our hospitals were not overwhelmed and are not overwhelmed at this hour."
4042,2020-04-05,"And I have to tell you that standing here today, I couldn't be more proud to stand alongside this President and to be a part of this team that has served the American people during this challenging hour."
4043,2020-04-05,"And I just say to you: To every American looking on, as we see the numbers leveling and maybe even beginning to go down, I just encourage you to keep doing what you're doing. Because of the sacrifices that Americans and American families have made through these mitigation efforts, you're saving lives and you're seeing our nation through this time."
4044,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
4045,2020-04-05,"Well, you don't know that. You don't know that."
4046,2020-04-05,You don't know that. I'm sorry.
4047,2020-04-05,"You don't know that. No, you made a statement. You don't know that."
4048,2020-04-05,And we would — and we would like to have their cooperation. And we are going to have their cooperation. They will cooperate perfectly. Watch.
4049,2020-04-05,"All right, go ahead, with the face mask. Go ahead."
4050,2020-04-05,Barely.
4051,2020-04-05,"I hear you well, actually."
4052,2020-04-05,"Well, we're looking at that certainly. I heard that complaint, but the mayor seems to be very happy with everything we've done."
4053,2020-04-05,"I mean, she's actually — and she was on today, saying very good things."
4054,2020-04-05,"Okay, yeah. Go ahead in the back."
4055,2020-04-05,"It does. And I hope that won't happen. I certainly hope that won't happen, but it does weigh on my mind."
4056,2020-04-05,"Okay, in the back, go ahead. You had one. Go ahead."
4057,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
4058,2020-04-05,"China has their own difficulties. We have a relationship with China that — we're not happy with certain things that happened over the last period of time, as you know, and I've been very explicit on that. But we know all about that."
4059,2020-04-05,"And, no, China is — we've seen what they did. We've seen many other things that they've done, both pro and con. And we'll be just fine."
4060,2020-04-05,"I don't want to say that, but we're going to be putting out guidelines and recommendations fairly quickly. In a few days."
4061,2020-04-05,"I'm not going to say. But, look, certain states are doing very well. Certain big parts of the country are doing very well. They're doing, really, very well. And so we're going to be putting out recommendations and guidelines very soon."
4062,2020-04-05,Steve?
4063,2020-04-05,"Well, you're going to see. I — I don't want to tell you now, but right now we have a very strong indication that we know, pretty much — we have some good ideas."
4064,2020-04-05,"I also do want to get — I want to have — we'll have video conference or at least a conference call with a lot of very good people, having to do with certain fields, whether it's energy or whether it's entertainment and restaurants, et cetera, et cetera."
4065,2020-04-05,"We have to get people back into restaurants. We have to do what we have to do. Whether it's deductibility or not, we'll see, but it should be deductibility. You'll get them back so fast. I mean, they used to have deductibility. The restaurant business, it — it was one of the hot businesses. And then they ended it a long time ago, many years ago. But we may need that to get people back into the restaurants."
4066,2020-04-05,Please.
4067,2020-04-05,"Absentee ballot, are you talking about? Absentee ballot?"
4068,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know what she did. I mean, I didn't see that. When did that happen? Today?"
4069,2020-04-05,"Well, I wish her luck. I wish her a lot of luck."
4070,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
4071,2020-04-05,"We discussed many things. We did discuss China. We discussed many different things, but we — it was primarily a call on the oil, as you can imagine. And they were very helpful in getting a stabilization price, a stabilization of the number of barrels. I think the number is going to be closer to 20 — maybe 15, but closer to 20 than it is going to be to 10. And I think it was a very important call."
4072,2020-04-05,"I also spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia and that was a very important call. And the bottom nine is OPEC Plus. It's called OPEC Plus because there are other states also, other nations. We came to a very good agreement."
4073,2020-04-05,Please.
4074,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
4075,2020-04-05,"I would say mostly we were talking about China. We were talking about their borders. And we're talking about our borders a little bit — our borders with Mexico. Because, as you know, Mexico is a big part of the deal. And Mexico really — it was very complex from the standpoint of Mexico. It was not an easy deal for Mexico. And the President — we appreciated a certain amount of flexibility. But we talked about borders, we talked about China, we talked about Mexico."
4076,2020-04-05,"Well, I mean, I — we did talk about the arms. Yes, we did. That was a very important part of the call actually. Yeah, good point."
4077,2020-04-05,Please.
4078,2020-04-05,"Well, they have to get the material. You know, the governors have to get the material."
4079,2020-04-05,"Now, if they can't get it, they're going to see us."
4080,2020-04-05,"I'm talking about the local governments. I'm talking about governors have to get the material. Now, they have machines. In fact, we — we're going to go into — I'd ask Mike to go into it as soon as I leave. They have very powerful machines that they don't know they even have. I'm not talking about Abbott; I'm talking about the governors. They have machines that are used for this —"
4081,2020-04-05,You know what I'm talk- — do you know what I'm referring to?
4082,2020-04-05,"Very big, very powerful machines where, in a certain state's case, they're only using 10 percent of their capacity and they didn't know it. That happens to be Illinois."
4083,2020-04-05,"Jon, please."
4084,2020-04-05,What do you think the answer to that is?
4085,2020-04-05,Rapidly increasing the numbers.
4086,2020-04-05,"Rapidly increases. Well, pretty quickly."
4087,2020-04-05,"Well, you have other machines where they can really work."
4088,2020-04-05,And a lot of the states have the big machines that can do a lot. They didn't even know they had them. They didn't even know that they had them. And Mike is going to be talking about that.
4089,2020-04-05,Yeah. Google and Apple.
4090,2020-04-05,You mean Google and Apple combination.
4091,2020-04-05,"No. A lot of people don't like it from the standpoint of constitutional rights. I mean, a lot of people don't like it and some people think it's great. No, they are working on that, as I understand."
4092,2020-04-05,"Yeah, no, I know that. I know that. I know."
4093,2020-04-05,"That's right. No, Google is looking at it, but Google is also working with Apple or looking at something. We have the greatest companies in the world looking at things that, in a year from now, everything that we're looking at now is going to be obsolete. That's how good it is."
4094,2020-04-05,"We have things happening that are unbelievable. I saw a presentation today that I can't talk about yet, but it's incredible. Plus, I think they're doing — Tony — I think they're doing very well in the vaccines. They're working hard on the vaccines and I think you'll have an answer for vaccines. I believe that there's some great things coming out with respect to that. Now you need a testing period, but you're going to have some great things."
4095,2020-04-05,Please.
4096,2020-04-05,"No, no. This is — this is the Google and Apple. I don't know if it's a partnership or what, but they're working on some —"
4097,2020-04-05,"They're working on more than one element. They're working on a couple of different things, Google and Apple. Google is also working on something, as you know, having to do with testing. I believe they're doing that in a singular fashion."
4098,2020-04-05,Okay.
4099,2020-04-05,Yeah. Yeah.
4100,2020-04-05,I know.
4101,2020-04-05,That's right.
4102,2020-04-05,"Well, it's an amazing thing, but a lot of people have some very big constitutional problems with it. You know that. It's an amazing thing and it would be — actually, as you know, other countries are thinking about using something similar but not as good."
4103,2020-04-05,"I hear Singapore is. Singapore is. No, Singapore had a little bit of a setback because they had a –they had a break. You know that, and — but they'll take care of it. I know — I know the folks in Singapore. They're doing a great job and they're going to put it back very quickly. But Singapore and other countries are looking at other things, and some countries are doing other things."
4104,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't want to get into that because we have a whole constitutional thing. We have more of a constitutional problem than a mechanical problem, but we will be making a determination on that. That's something we're going to be discussing with a lot of people over the next four weeks. That would be a very accurate way of doing it, but a lot of people have a problem with it."
4105,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Go ahead."
4106,2020-04-05,"Well, it's moving along. I think I can speak because I — I have to leave. Moving along quickly, moving along well. It's a test that's been going along for many, many years, except now we have very modern, very incredible versions of it. But that's moving on. The antibody test have — moving along very well."
4107,2020-04-05,"Okay, anymore COVID-19? COVID-19?"
4108,2020-04-05,"Yeah, Steve."
4109,2020-04-05,"Well, that's going through the Navy, as I understand it. The Navy is going to be making decisions on all of that. And they had a break in — I don't think the ship should have been stopping in Vietnam when you have a pandemic, to be honest with you. You know, I don't think the captain should have been writing letters. He's not Ernest Hemingway, as I said before, and he shouldn't have been writing letters."
4110,2020-04-05,"And I don't think — I don't know who gave the orders to stop in Vietnam. But they stopped in Vietnam and all of a sudden they get on, and now you have over 500 sailors and — and people on the ship that are affected. I don't know whose idea that was, but that wasn't such a good idea in the middle of a pandemic."
4111,2020-04-05,"Yes, please. Jon. Go ahead, Jon."
4112,2020-04-05,"Nothing changed it. No, no, I know exactly what you're going to say. Nothing changed it. The fact that I want to rely on states or maybe will or maybe have, and the fact that we've gotten on — that's one thing. The fact that I don't want to use the power is another thing. Look —"
4113,2020-04-05,"Yes, Constitution."
4114,2020-04-05,"Constitutionally. You can look at constitutionally. You can look at federalism. You can look at it any different way. Jon, the fact that I don't want to exert my power is much different. We have the power."
4115,2020-04-05,"You asked, “Does the federal government have the power?” The federal government has absolute power. It has the power. As to whether or not I'll use that power, we'll see. I would rather —"
4116,2020-04-05,"Jon, I would rather work with the states, because I like going down to a local government. That's why with — I guess it's now seven states not eight that — because South Carolina did — you know, they went away from what we discussed the last time. So that's why I looked at the individual states; they're doing a very good job. They're really doing a very good job. I'd rather have them make the decision."
4117,2020-04-05,"Now, the fact that I'd rather have — that's fine. But I have the absolute right to do if I want to. I may not want to. We have a very good relationship. Now, we'll see what happens."
4118,2020-04-05,"If you notice, the few states you're talking about, they're all with Democrat governors. But if governors are doing a good job and they control it better — because you don't have somebody in Washington saying, “Set up a testing site in the parking lot of a Walmart.” And we're in Washington and they're in a state that's very far away. That's really — it should be and it should have always been. And I've always said it was."
4119,2020-04-05,"But the relationship we have now with the states and governors is very good. And we'll be announcing, over the next very short period of time, exactly what we're going to be doing."
4120,2020-04-05,"Okay, a couple of more. Go ahead."
4121,2020-04-05,"Well, nobody has called about coronavirus, about — from their standpoint. Look, they had the H1N1, which is swine flu, and that was a big failure. That was a tremendous failure. They had a lot of failures. And you take a look at what — you take a look at the history. And, you know, 17,000 people died. And you talk about late? They were so late — they were late like it never even existed. That was a — that was a big problem. Caused a lot of other people a big problem too."
4122,2020-04-05,"So, you know, if Joe Biden would like a briefing, I'd certainly get him a briefing. I don't know what he'd do with it."
4123,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4124,2020-04-05,No.
4125,2020-04-05,"No, they're not. No."
4126,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Yes, go ahead, please."
4127,2020-04-05,"Well, you have Mike's task force, which is the White House Task Force, which really brought us up to this point brilliantly, I must say. Dealt with governors and dealt with governors all the way through. And I was on many of those calls. And every call got better and better and better. It was hostile at the beginning. By the time we finished — I mean, today's call was a very good call, a very friendly call. I think everyone is online."
4128,2020-04-05,"And again, you don't have anybody driving you crazy, saying they're not getting ventilators, they're not getting all of the different things, they need more beds. They have a lot of beds right now."
4129,2020-04-05,And we always err — and I think it's important for you know — we always erred on the sake of “Give them more.” Even when we didn't think — we didn't think New York needed the beds that they were asking for. We didn't think they needed the ventilators that they asked for. And we were right.
4130,2020-04-05,"Now, on ventilators, we're ready to march. I told you this: We're ready to march. We have 10,000 ventilators. We're ready to move them anywhere in the country when we need them, if we need them. We're also building a lot of ventilators, and that's going to be used at some point, I believe. You know we're going to have stockpiles, including state stockpiles if they want to work out some kind of an arrangement with us. But we're also going to help other countries, whether it's Italy, or Spain, or other — France is having a big problem. They all desperately need — Germany too — they need ventilators."
4131,2020-04-05,"So we're going to have a lot of ventilators. We have a lot — you heard the numbers — we have a lot coming next week. Next week, we have a tremendous amount coming."
4132,2020-04-05,"Okay, final question. Steve."
4133,2020-04-05,"No. Then we have — in addition to that, we have a number of committees. We'll have a transportation committee. We're going to have a manufacturing committee. You'll see it tomorrow."
4134,2020-04-05,"We're also having a religious leaders committee. We have a great group of religious leaders. We're having committees with religious leaders. You've been seeing what's going on with the churches, and all of that. And we're going to have a faith leaders committee."
4135,2020-04-05,"And so we have — we're going to have a few committees. I'll call them “committees,” and then ultimately we're going to make decisions. So we're going to make decisions fairly quickly, and I think they're going to be the correct decision. I hope so."
4136,2020-04-05,Steve.
4137,2020-04-05,Soon. Soon. And they already know what I want.
4138,2020-04-05,"And so, when we form — when you say “form,” I don't have to give them instructions. These are very sophisticated people. These are the best people in their fields. So I don't have to say, “Gee, let's — we just met and we're going to meet in two weeks and here's what we're...” I said, “Here's what I want.” We've already told them. And they're the —"
4139,2020-04-05,"— the best names in the various businesses and professions and religions. I mean, they're — these are the greatest names. The people that, I think, probably know the best."
4140,2020-04-05,"So, we've called them and we're going to be speaking to them very soon. And we want them to have — if it's questions, or statements, we want them to have that for us. And we will have either a response, or maybe — I mean, ideally we're going to be learning from them. And we'll be able to do that and put them — put everything we learned from those calls into our new guidelines."
4141,2020-04-05,So we're going to have new guidelines coming soon. I think it's going to be very good. I think it's going to be very smooth. And I hope it's going to be very safe.
4142,2020-04-05,Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
4143,2020-04-05,Stanley Chera is a friend of mine for a long time. He's a great real estate person — passed away. Was a great real estate person. Great. Great. Sort of a legend in New York real estate.
4144,2020-04-05,"He called me a couple of weeks ago, said he tested positive. Stanley is in his early- to mid-80s, I guess. And Stanley went to the hospital and he never came out. He went into a coma. He was unconscious for a long period of time and he never made it. A great man. He left — very charitable, really a great philanthropist. A very, very successful person in Manhattan, in the real estate business. So I got to know him a lot."
4145,2020-04-05,"He was so excited when his friend from New York became the President of the United States. He was like — like a young boy. And he was not a young boy, but he was like a young boy. He was so excited. He thought we'd do such a good job and he was so happy. And he — he was very proud of what we've done in this administration."
4146,2020-04-05,"But he was tested positive, and unfortunately he — he didn't make it. It's a very — to me, it's a very sad thing."
4147,2020-04-05,Thank you all very much. Thank you.
4148,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Thank you. Today I'd like to provide you with an update in our war against the coronavirus. Thanks to our comprehensive strategy and extraordinary devotion to our citizens — we've had such tremendous support all over — we continue to see encouraging signs of progress.
4149,2020-04-05,"Cases in New York area, New Orleans, Detroit, Boston, and Houston are declining. Denver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Nashville, Indianapolis, and St. Louis are all stable and declining. All parts of the country are either in good shape, getting better. In all cases, getting better. And we're seeing very little that we're going to look at as a superseding hotspot. Things are moving along. Really, a horrible situation that we've been confronted with, but they're moving along."
4150,2020-04-05,"As we express our gratitude for these hard-fought gains, however, we continue to mourn with thousands of families across the country whose loved ones have been stolen from us by the invisible enemy. We grieve by their side as one family — this great American family. And we do grieve."
4151,2020-04-05,"We also stand in solidarity with the thousands of Americans who are ill and waging a brave fight against the virus. We're doing everything in our power to heal the sick and to gradually re-open our nation, and to safely get our people back to work. They want to get back to work, and they want to get back to work soon. There's a hunger for getting our country back, and it's happening, and it's happening faster than people would think."
4152,2020-04-05,Ensuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation. These goals work in tandem. They work side by side.
4153,2020-04-05,"It's clear that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread has been working and is saving countless lives. For those who are infected, we have taken unprecedented action to ensure they have the highest level of care anywhere in the world. The federal government has built more than 11,000 extra beds, shipped or delivered hundreds of millions of pieces of personal protective equipment, as you know — in fact, some of the people here are going to be talking about it; some of our greatest executives — some of the greatest anywhere in the world — and distributed over 10,000 ventilators."
4154,2020-04-05,"And we now have, in a very short period of time — many have been delivered, and hundreds of thousands are being built. And frankly, every governor has more ventilators right now than they know what to do with. They're actually shipping them to different locations, and we're shipping some to our allies and others throughout the world, because we have ventilators like — the job that they've done in getting this very complex piece of equipment built is actually incredible. You don't hear about ventilators anymore except in a positive way."
4155,2020-04-05,"We've launched the most ambitious testing effort, likewise, on Earth. The United States has now conducted more than 5.4 million tests — nearly double the number tested in any other country. More than twice as much as any other country. Think of that."
4156,2020-04-05,"Moments ago, I came from a meeting with some of our nation's largest retailers, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Kroger. We're joined by leaders of those great companies. And we also have with us the leaders from the world's top medical diagnostics companies and suppliers: Thermo Fisher, LabCorp, Quest, U.S. Cotton, and the American Clinical Laboratory Association. These are great — great companies."
4157,2020-04-05,"These private-sector leaders, along with others such as Roche, Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Hologic, and Cephe– Cepheid, have been exceptional partners in an unprecedented drive to expand the states' capabilities and our country's capabilities. The job they've done has been incredible. The testing that's been developed and being developed right now has been truly an amazing thing."
4158,2020-04-05,"I want to thank Abbott Laboratories for the job they've done. I want to thank Roche. And in particular, those two have really stepped forward. Abbott with a five-minute test that people can take, and in five minutes they know what the — what the answer is."
4159,2020-04-05,"I'd like to ask, if I could, the executives of these great companies — and they are — they have really helped us a lot over the last 45-day period. We're talking about a 45-day period when many of us met. And since then, what Walmart and the others have done has been nothing short of amazing."
4160,2020-04-05,"So I just want to ask them to come forward and say a few words about their company. Plus, they're going to make a big contribution to our country."
4161,2020-04-05,"Please. Come forward, please. Thank you."
4162,2020-04-05,Thank you.
4163,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Please, go ahead. Please."
4164,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Great job.
4165,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Great job.
4166,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you.
4167,2020-04-05,Great job. Thank you very much.
4168,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Thank you.
4169,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Doug. Great job. Thank you."
4170,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
4171,2020-04-05,"So thank you all very much. It's incredible what we've done together over a short period of time. I want to thank our Vice President for the task force and the work. Every day, it gets better."
4172,2020-04-05,"And we had a fantastic goal with the governors today, and I would say that they are as — as thrilled as they can be, considering that the fact is that there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way. And the whole world is suffering because of it — 184 countries at least."
4173,2020-04-05,"But I want to thank all of these great businessmen and women for the job they've done. They have been fantastic with us, working with us. And, as you know, for several weeks, my administration has encouraged the governors to leverage unused testing capacity in states. Very few understood that we have tremendous capacity."
4174,2020-04-05,"Then, one week ago, we provided each governor with a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they could find additional testing capacity in their states. Within 48 hours, the number of tests performed across the country began to absolutely skyrocket."
4175,2020-04-05,"On Saturday alone, more than 200,000 test results were reported, which is a gigantic number — bigger than any country anywhere in the world for a much longer period of time; a number that is an increase earlier in the month when we tested roughly less than 100,000 a day. So we much more than doubled it, and that will be doubling again very shortly."
4176,2020-04-05,"We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening. And the reopening process — we want to get our country open. And the testing is not going to be a problem at all. In fact, it's going to be one of the great assets that we have."
4177,2020-04-05,"Today we're releasing additional guidance on testing to inform the states as they develop their plans for a phased and very safe reopening. Our blueprint describes how states should unlock their full capacity, expand the number of testing platforms, establish monitoring systems to detect local outbreaks, and conduct contact tracing. We have it all."
4178,2020-04-05,"Other countries are calling to find out what are we doing and how do you do it. And we're helping them. We're dealing with a lot of countries, helping them on testing, just like we did on the ventilators."
4179,2020-04-05,"I directed our Medicare program to make it easier for seniors to get the testing that they need. And the pharmacies — as you know, we are allowing pharmacies now to do testing. And we have other testing locations that we're going to be allowing also, but having pharmacies get involved in testing is a very big deal. We're also asking governors to do the same in their Medicaid program. So they're going to be able and authorized to do the same in Medicaid. So it's a big — that's a big deal."
4180,2020-04-05,"So we're deploying the full power and strength of the federal government to help states, cities — to help local government get this horrible plague over with and over with fast. There's tremendous energy in our country right now. There's energy like people haven't seen in a long time — a spirit that they have not seen. And we're doing very well — very well — considering what happened to us and considering if you look at what happened to others."
4181,2020-04-05,"This is something that the world has not seen for a long, long time. You can probably go back to 1917, where it was a terrible period of time. You all know what happened in 1917. That's over 100 years ago."
4182,2020-04-05,"With that, I'd like to introduce, if I might — Dr. Birx, if you could come up. And then, Admiral, you'll come up. And between the two of you, you'll explain the entire process and how much progress we've made and where we're going."
4183,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Thank you.
4184,2020-04-05,Very good. Thank you. Good job.
4185,2020-04-05,"Admiral, please."
4186,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Thank you. Great job. Thanks, Brett."
4187,2020-04-05,"Okay. So with that, we're here to answer some questions, and Mike is up here also. So, we'll answer."
4188,2020-04-05,"Steve, please go ahead."
4189,2020-04-05,"Well, we want them to do it. We recommend that they do it as quickly as possible, but safely. We want everyone to be safe. And I think you're seeing that. You're seeing a lot of governors get out and they want to open it up. Many are thinking about their school system. Not a long way to go in the school system right now for this season, for this year, but I think you'll see a lot of schools open up even if it's for a very short period of time. I think it would be a good thing."
4190,2020-04-05,"Because, as you see, in terms of what this vicious virus goes after, young people seem to do very well. Young people seem to do very well."
4191,2020-04-05,"So I know that there are some governors that aren't necessarily ready to open up their states, but they may be ready to open up their school systems. We'll see. But that's their choice. But the word is “safety.” Okay? Rapid, but safety."
4192,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Go ahead, please."
4193,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4194,2020-04-05,"Well, I think it's a very unfair question because you have many great professionals, some of them you have great respect for, and you have many people in the other party — you mention Alex Azar, but you have many people in the other party that have said the same thing and with even more confidence. So a lot of people didn't get that right."
4195,2020-04-05,"I was — I was very fortunate, whether it was through luck or whatever, that we closed the border. We put a ban on China — other than our citizens coming in. We had our citizens — you can't keep out American citizens. You know, “Gee, you can't come back into your country.” That's a little tough to do."
4196,2020-04-05,"But we put a ban on China that was very fortunate. But I could tell you that Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets in Chinatown. She wanted to go, “Let's go out and party.” That was late into February. So you don't mention that, but you could mention that."
4197,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. Any other? Please, go ahead."
4198,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Stand up."
4199,2020-04-05,You — you should have no complaints.
4200,2020-04-05,Please.
4201,2020-04-05,"Well, I can only say what we're doing. We're reporting very accurately. If you look at other countries, other countries are not. I mean, you can look at China. You can look at numerous countries where I don't think those are right numbers."
4202,2020-04-05,"I can only say what we're doing. It's very important to us to do very accurate reporting, and that's what we're doing."
4203,2020-04-05,"Jon, go ahead. Please."
4204,2020-04-05,Thank you. Please.
4205,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4206,2020-04-05,"Well, I just came out and I hadn't heard. I heard there was a glitch. We'll find out whether or not that's so. Certainly it did work out very well for the original amount of money. This is the second amount. And I'll find out about that. We'll find — we're relying on the banks to go out and do an accurate job."
4207,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. In the back."
4208,2020-04-05,"Well, I wouldn't mind doing that. I don't know what the legal status of something like that — I would like to do that, as far as I'm concerned. I'm not involved in that process, but I would certainly like to have it listed. I'd have to find out if there's a legal problem. But if there isn't, I would do it gladly."
4209,2020-04-05,Please.
4210,2020-04-05,"Well, Charlie, there are a lot of ways you can hold them accountable. We're doing very serious investigations, as you probably know. And we are not happy with China. We are not happy with that whole situation because we believe it could have been stopped at the source, it could have been stopped quickly, and it wouldn't have spread all over the world. And we think that should have happened. So we'll let you know at the appropriate time, but we are doing serious investigations."
4211,2020-04-05,"Well, we've already discussed that, and especially having to do with medical supplies and others — and others. If you look prior to this virus, the deficit was coming way down under my administration because I put massive tariffs on China. We took in tens of billions of dollars. Gave some of it to the farmers who were unfairly targeted by China. Nobody has ever done that before. We never took in 10 cents from China."
4212,2020-04-05,"Now, all of a sudden, I think you know very well, we've taken in tens of billions of dollars. I helped the farmers by giving them, two years ago, $12 billion — all coming from China — and we had plenty leftover too. And then the following year, $16 billion. And this year, we're also going to help our farmers. But nobody has ever done a thing like that. Because they were targeted unfairly by China."
4213,2020-04-05,"So we're doing a very strong investigation, and we'll let you know what the result of that is. We should be able to get the answers too."
4214,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
4215,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we're looking very much and reliant very much on the local areas, the governors. And that's been the way it has been for me, maybe not for everybody. But for me, that's the way it's been at the beginning and from the beginning."
4216,2020-04-05,"The governors — some of them — are doing an extraordinary job. Not all of them, but some of them. And I think all of them maybe hasn't have a chance to do that. Some will be a little bit different. The areas are much different. Manhattan is much different than Montana. You have a lot of different circumstances, but — and obviously, if you look at the virus, it hits some areas. Hasn't hit very much other areas, not even at all. Almost not at all."
4217,2020-04-05,"But the entire country has been infected. West Virginia — as an example, I spoke to Jim Justice, the governor of West Virginia, and they were along before anything hit and they had numerous deaths, even in West Virginia. And they were really the last one to be hit."
4218,2020-04-05,"So we're dealing with the governors. We had a really great call today, as I told you. Very, very solid. These are — these were not complaining people. These were people that were — they had everything they needed. They had their ventilators. They have their testing. They see their testing is growing. They're growing their testing. We're helping them. We're getting them what they need. And that was a group — I wish — I mean, I'm sure some of you were on the line, even though supposed to be. And I think you know what the result you weren't of that call was."
4219,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
4220,2020-04-05,"Well, we can do something much easier than that. We have ways of doing things a lot easier than that. But Germany is looking at things and we're looking at things. And we're talking about a lot more money than Germany is talking about."
4221,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please go ahead."
4222,2020-04-05,We haven't determined the final amount yet.
4223,2020-04-05,"It's very substantial. If you take a look at the world — I mean, this is worldwide damage. This is damage to the U.S., but this is damage to the world."
4224,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4225,2020-04-05,"Well, you'd have to ask Attorney General Barr, but I think he wants to see — like everybody, he wants to see people get back and wants to see people get back to work. He doesn't want people to be held up when there's no reason for doing it. In some cases, perhaps it's too strict. He wants to make sure people have their rights and they maintain their rights, very importantly."
4226,2020-04-05,"So a lot of people would agree with him. But you'd actually have to ask that question specifically, from a legal standpoint, to Attorney General Barr."
4227,2020-04-05,"It would depend on the state. It would depend on the circumstances of the state. I mean, some states are, you know, perhaps a little early, and some states are a little bit late. And the Attorney General — I read that and I saw that — and, frankly, the Attorney General doesn't want to have rights taken away. Because, you know, there are some people, they're not allowed to open up a store or — you know, they're going to lose their livelihood."
4228,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, that causes death also, between all of the things that happen. And this has been a big study. You know, the fact that people aren't allowed to have their freedom causes a tremendous amount of problems, including death. So that's what he's talking about."
4229,2020-04-05,"Please, in the back."
4230,2020-04-05,I can't imagine why. I can't imagine why. Yeah.
4231,2020-04-05,"No, I don't. No, I can't imagine — I can't imagine that."
4232,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead, please."
4233,2020-04-05,"Well, that — it doesn't really matter what they say there — and we just left him; we just had a meeting –but — because we're going to have much more than double it very soon."
4234,2020-04-05,"Now, there are big believers in testing, and then there are some governors that don't feel as strongly about it at all. You understand that. They feel much differently about it."
4235,2020-04-05,"But we're going with maximum testing, because it's something we're very capable of doing. But we'll be much more than doubled."
4236,2020-04-05,"You know, Mike, I'd like you to answer that. We're going to be much higher than doubled on testing very shortly."
4237,2020-04-05,"Mike, please."
4238,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, Jon."
4239,2020-04-05,"I think it's very important to know — and this you can get from any other country, I think, if they're being honest — not only do we have the most testing in the world by far, but we have, by far, the best testing."
4240,2020-04-05,I will only say this: I think that General Flynn is a wonderful man. He had a wonderful career. And it was a disgrace what happened to General Flynn. Let's see what happens now. But what happened to General Flynn should never happen again in our country. What happened to other people should never happen again in our country. What happened to your President of the United States should never again be allowed to happen.
4241,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
4242,2020-04-05,"I don't know. But I can tell you the third and the fourth quarter, in particular, are going to be, I think, spectacular. We were talking about it with the executives. I think we're going to have a phenomenal third quarter. Nobody, you know, except one country, can be held accountable for what happened. Nobody is blaming anybody here. We're looking at a group of people that should have stopped it at the source."
4243,2020-04-05,"But — so what happens in second, happens in second. What we are doing is — I think we're going to have — you're going to see a big rise in the third, but you're going to see an — an incredible fourth quarter, and you're going to have an incredible next year."
4244,2020-04-05,"I think you're going to have a recovery. Look, I built — they were just telling me inside, and it's fact — I built the greatest economy — with the help of 325 million people, I built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And one day, because of something that should have never been allowed to happen, we had to close our country, we had to close our economy."
4245,2020-04-05,"I built it. We had the best employment numbers and the best unemployment numbers for Hispanic American, for African American, for Asian American, for everybody — best stock market numbers. And, by the way, the stock market was up very substantially today and people are seeing a lot of good things. A lot of very smart people investing in the stock market right now. It's at 24,000 — approximately 24,000."
4246,2020-04-05,"And if you would've said, with a tragedy that this country had to endure and go through, with all of the death and the people that died and were so badly hurt by what happened, and you can only say God bless them — but if you would've said that our country would be in the position we're in now — we're ready to move forward."
4247,2020-04-05,"We'll never forget loved ones. We'll never forget these great people that sacrifice for a reason of incompetence or something else other than incompetence. What happened at a point where they could have protected the whole world — not just us, the whole world."
4248,2020-04-05,"But we had the greatest economy ever in the history of our world, and I had to turn it off in order to get to a point where we are today. And now we're making a comeback. And I think we're going to have, economically — from an economic standpoint, next year — an unbelievable year. And I think that you're going to see a fantastic fourth quarter, and the third quarter will start to build. But the second quarter, obviously, you're going to have GDP lack of growth."
4249,2020-04-05,"I'm looking at the head of Walmart. What a job Walmart has done in going through something. I mean, they were — they were doing yeoman's work, including getting us millions of — of, really, very, very protective outfits. And — and — I mean, the job that Doug and Walmart did was incredible. Millions of outfits. And those are high quality. I've seen them. Those a high quality. That's what we need."
4250,2020-04-05,"So people have stepped up to the plate. I think we're going to have a really good — I think it's good to start building. I think it's going to build fast. I think it'll be a tremendous, tremendous comeback."
4251,2020-04-05,"And, you know, so I say I built the greatest economy — with all of the people that helped me and all of the people in this country, we built the greatest economy the world has ever seen. And we're going to do it again. And it's not going to be that long. Okay?"
4252,2020-04-05,"Yes, please. Go ahead."
4253,2020-04-05,"Well, we're looking at that, and it depends on how long it's taken Europe to heal. Italy is starting to make a comeback. I'm very happy to see that, with my friend, the Prime Minister. He's — it's tragic what went on in Italy and Spain and France and Germany, frankly, and every — every country over there. It's tragic. But we'll be looking at what's happening in Europe. And certainly, we want to do that and they want to do it too. They want to do it very badly."
4254,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4255,2020-04-05,Say it?
4256,2020-04-05,"On Kim Jong Un? I can't tell you exactly. Yes, I do have a very good idea, but I can't talk about it now. I just wish him well. I've had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un."
4257,2020-04-05,"If I weren't President, you'd be in war. You would've been in war with Korea. You would have been in war with North Korea if I wasn't President — that, I can tell you. He expected that — that, I can tell you."
4258,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4259,2020-04-05,"I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? November 3rd. It's a good number. No, I look forward to that election."
4260,2020-04-05,"And that was just made-up propaganda — not by him, but by some of the many people that are working, writing little statements. I see all the time: “Statement made...” You say, “So, statement made per Joe Biden.” Sleepy Joe. He didn't make those statements, but somebody did. But they said he made it. No, let him know I — I'm not thinking about it at all. Not at all."
4261,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. In the back, please. Please."
4262,2020-04-05,"Oh, I don't know. I haven't seen the report. I haven't seen the report."
4263,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Go ahead."
4264,2020-04-05,He didn't say anything last Saturday.
4265,2020-04-05,"Nobody — nobody knows where he is, so he obviously couldn't have said it. If you have a — this is breaking news."
4266,2020-04-05,"That Kim Jong Un made a statement on Saturday, I don't think so."
4267,2020-04-05,"Okay, go ahead. Let's do — let's do one more. Please, in the back."
4268,2020-04-05,"So, yeah, we've lost a lot of people. But if you look at what original projections were — 2.2 million — we're probably heading to 60,000, 70,000. It's far too many. One person is too many for this."
4269,2020-04-05,"And I think we've made a lot of really good decisions. The big decision was closing the border or doing the ban — people coming in from China — obviously, other than American citizens, which had to come in. Can't say, “You can't come in. You can't come back to your country.”"
4270,2020-04-05,I think we've made a lot of good decisions. I think that Mike Pence and the task force have done a fantastic job.
4271,2020-04-05,I think that everybody working on the ventilators — you see what we've done there — have done unbelievable. The press doesn't talk about ventilators anymore. They just don't want to talk about them and that's okay. But the reason they don't want to talk — that was a subject that nobody would get off of. They don't want to talk about them.
4272,2020-04-05,"We're in the same position on testing. We are lapping the world on testing. And the world is coming to us. As I said, they're coming to us, saying, “What are you doing? How do you do it?” And we're helping them."
4273,2020-04-05,"So, no, I think we've done a great job. And one person — I will say this: One person is too many."
4274,2020-04-05,Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
4275,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Just before we begin, I want to mention we're working very hard — long — on getting a young group of people out of Peru. We've removed some, and the rest are being removed with the cooperation of the Peruvian government. And we're also dealing with Honduras on getting some people out that got caught up. And we are working on that very well — again, with the Honduran government's work. And they're working with us, so I appreciate that."
4276,2020-04-05,"We have a couple of other locations that we'll report to you, and we were able to get a young woman released from a certain area who was being horribly accosted, horribly treated. And we spoke to General Milley. General Milley took care of it. We went in and we got her out. And we'll — we'll report further on that one. But it's — that was rough stuff."
4277,2020-04-05,I want to thank General Milley. I want to thank all of the people that were involved and the people that went in to get her. I want to thank you very much.
4278,2020-04-05,"As we continue to marshal every resource at America's disposal in the fight against the Chinese virus, we're profoundly grateful to our nation's state and local leaders, doctors, nurses, law enforcement, and first responders who are waging this battle on the ground."
4279,2020-04-05,"It is absolutely critical that Americans continue to follow the federal government's guidelines — so important — about social distancing, nonessential travel, and hand washing. Defeating this unseen enemy requires the help and commitment of every single American."
4280,2020-04-05,"I want to just say that Senator Rand Paul — a friend of mine; he's been a great friend of mine. He's been always there when we needed him, when the country needed him. And, as you know, he just tested positive. Jose [sic] Díaz-Balart — spoke to him yesterday — tested positive."
4281,2020-04-05,"And so people are — they're getting quite close to home, and it's a terrible thing that's going on. The hidden enemy. I call it the hidden enemy. And I think they'll all be fine. I hope they're going to be fine. But I just want to send our regards — and I think I can speak on behalf of our country — to those two great friends of mine."
4282,2020-04-05,"We're working urgently with Congress on legislation to support the millions of workers, small businesses, and industries who've been hit hard by the virus through no fault of their own. Our goal is to get relief to Americans as quickly as possible so that families can get by and small businesses can keep workers on the payroll."
4283,2020-04-05,"This will help our economy, and you will see our economy skyrocket once this is over. I think it's going to skyrocket. It's a — it's a pent-up demand. It's a built-up demand. And I guess you really have to say, “Who knows?” But I think it's going to be a tremendous day when we win this war — and we will win the war. We want to win the war with as few — if you look at it — just deaths as possible. We want to have as few number of deaths as possible."
4284,2020-04-05,"Today, I'm announcing action to help New York, California, and Washington ensure that the National Guard can effectively respond to this crisis. The National Guard — these are tremendous people. They're fully on alert. We've signed what we had to sign, and it's been activated."
4285,2020-04-05,"We're dealing also with other states. These states have been hit the hardest. Actually, pretty much by far, you could say, the hardest. Everybody can see that. Just look at the numbers."
4286,2020-04-05,"And, through FEMA, the federal government will be funding 100 percent of the cost of deploying National Guard units to carry out approved missions to stop the virus while those governors remain in command. So the governors, locally, are going to be in command, and we'll be following them and we hope they can do the job, and I think they will. I spoke with all three of the governors today, and — just a little while ago – and they're very happy with what we're going to be doing because we'll be announcing some other things for those three states and some other states where it's hit the hardest."
4287,2020-04-05,This action will give them maximum flexibility to use the Guard against the virus without having to worry about costs or liability and freeing up state resources to protect the health and safety of the people in their state.
4288,2020-04-05,"The federal government has deployed hundreds of tons of supplies from our National Stockpile to locations with the greatest need. In order to assist in those areas, I approved the State of New York's request for a major disaster declaration — something which Governor Cuomo has been asking for and which I agree. And we had it done in very rapid fashion. We approved this on Friday evening, and we are working very, very hard to get all of these things not only signed up but completed and finished and win."
4289,2020-04-05,"The request from the State of Washington for a major disaster declaration was approved just a little while ago. It went through the process and we moved it very quickly. The request from the State of California was just received, and we will have it approved very quickly. We'll be working — I told that to Gavin Newsom. And we are — we're working on getting that done very quickly; it'll be done maybe tonight."
4290,2020-04-05,"We've large — we have large quantities of medical equipment and supplies on the way, based on all of this, to those states including: respirators, surgical masks, and gowns, face shields, coveralls, and gloves, with large quantities already delivered to Washington and to New York."
4291,2020-04-05,"In addition to large quantities of supplies, I've also directed FEMA to supply the following: four large federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight large federal medical stations with 2,000 beds for California, and three large federal medical stations and four small federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for the State of Washington. The governors know. The supplies en route to California and New York will be delivered within the next 48 hours."
4292,2020-04-05,"In addition, the Naval Hospital ship, the USNS Mercy — it's an incredible ship; these two ships are incredible — one on the West Coast; one on the East Coast — will be deployed to Los Angeles to add emergency surge medical capacity. And they have a tremendous capacity. They are really something."
4293,2020-04-05,"I will say that, if you look at some of the things we've been doing — and now those numbers have gone up — and just to be a little bit more exacting, we've done a presidential approval for request for a major disaster declaration for the State of New York. Approval of Title 32 National Guard activation for the State of New York. We're providing all of this at no cost to the governor."
4294,2020-04-05,"I spoke with Governor Cuomo. He's working hard. We're all working hard together. The relationship has really been amazing. But it also enables the governor to provide robust National Guard support to the state. And the 25 percent — we're going to be waiving that 25 percent cost. We're picking up, we'll be coordinating, and they'll be doing something with very special people."
4295,2020-04-05,"Mission assignment of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide support to build out alternate care sites. They're doing various alternate care sites, which have now been designated by New York. Four large federal medical stations of one thousand beds. These are very complex places, actually, with great equipment and great people."
4296,2020-04-05,"Strategic National Stockpile order. And this is as of a number of days ago — so far delivered to New York — and this is the 19th. We had the N95 respirators — 186,416 delivered. We've delivered 444,078 surgical masks. Many have been delivered since then. Face shields — we've delivered 84,560 face shields. Surgical gowns — surgical gowns — 68,944 to New York. Coveralls — 352. Gloves — 245,486. Also, to New York, in terms of what's been delivered just since then — the numbers are quite large, and we have tremendous numbers of companies also making equipment."
4297,2020-04-05,"For the State of Washington, we've delivered 369,000 N95 respirators, 507,406 surgical masks. And this is as of about three days ago. Face shields — 63,788 face shields. Surgical gowns — 107,850. Gloves — 240,376. And we have many, many things pending. It's actually not pending; it's being — they're being fabricated. They're being made. And they're moving. Now, for Washington — so we have four small federal medical stations, 250 beds. And for Washington — State of Washington — we have three large federal medical stations, 750 beds. And then you have, as I said, the approval of the Title 32 National Guard."
4298,2020-04-05,"State of California — again, to be very precise — we're going to have the approval of the Title 32 National Guard activation. And we're providing all of this again, like in New York, at no cost to the governor — meaning to Governor Newsom and the state. No cost to the state. It enables the governor to provide robust National Guard support to the state. So they're going to have control of the National Guard. The federal government is sending — these are incredible people that are being sent."
4299,2020-04-05,"We have eight large federal medical stations with over 2,000 beds, and that's going to California. And then Strategic National Stockpile order — we've ordered, likewise, hundreds of thousands of different items. I won't go into the exact numbers, but the numbers are very substantial. But we're having a tremendous additional number sent."
4300,2020-04-05,"And whatever the states can get, they should be getting. I say we're sort of a backup for the states. And some of the states are doing really well and some don't do as well. The ones that don't do as well need more help, but these are three states that really do need help because they are — they are hit very hard."
4301,2020-04-05,And the outpouring from the private sector has also been extraordinary. I'm pleased to report that Honeywell — great company — has just announced it will immediately expand its personal protective equipment manufacturing operations in Rhode Island to produce millions of additional N95 masks. They're very hard to get. They're actually quite complex. For the U.S. government's Strategic National Stockpile. They'll be immediately then delivered to the various states.
4302,2020-04-05,"This expansion is already underway, and it's going to provide a lot of jobs for that state — probably around 500. The masks will be distributed by the government for the use of the health, safety, and emergency. And this is for response workers — primarily for response workers. These are very high-end."
4303,2020-04-05,This expansion is in addition to Honeywell's action to more than double production of its existing personal protective equipment manufacturing plants. They make a lot of different things and they're doubling and tripling their production. They're going around the clock.
4304,2020-04-05,"Today, I'm also announcing the launch of a new public-private consortium organized by the White House, the Department of Energy, and IBM to unleash the power of American supercomputing resources to fight the Chinese virus. The following leaders from private industries, academia, and government will be contributing, and they're going to be contributing a lot of different things, but primarily computing resources to help researchers discover new treatments and vaccines. They'll be working along with NIH and all of the people that are working on this."
4305,2020-04-05,"But tremendous help from IBM, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, MIT, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Department of Energy's national labor — laboratories, the National Science Foundation, and NASA. They're all contributing to this effort, and they're fully in gear."
4306,2020-04-05,"This afternoon, I also want to update you on the steps we're taking to protect and serve our country's 18 million veterans. These are great people — our amazing veterans. They've shown their eternal loyalty to our nation, and this is the time where they're in need, and we are going to show our loyalty to them. We're being very protective of our veterans."
4307,2020-04-05,"We're working on certain hospitals where we may be doing some work — in Louisiana, in particular, and some other states. Veterans hospitals. We're going to be very protective of our veterans. Some of them are of that very vulnerable age. And some of them, obviously, are not feeling well. And some of them are still suffering the wounds of war from many years ago."
4308,2020-04-05,"Yesterday, I signed vital legislation to ensure that the G.I. Bill will cover distance learning during this emergency. I also spoke with many of our veteran service organizations, or the VSOs, to describe our unprecedented action. In February, the Department of Veterans Affairs established 19 emergency operation centers throughout the country."
4309,2020-04-05,"One of the things that they've been trying to get done for many years — you all know this from following me over the last number of years, but we got it done pretty quickly; they've been trying to get it done for many, many decades — was Choice. Veterans Choice and also Veterans Accountability."
4310,2020-04-05,"Now, if it's crowded within this — if they can't get to a doctor — we have great doctors in the VA. I have to say that. We have fantastic doctors — as good as they come. But it's hard to because of what was bureaucracy, but no longer bureaucracy. We've done a lot of things, in that case, because of Accountability. When people aren't doing their jobs or if they're bad or if they're sadistic, or if they steal or anything bad happens, we're now allowed to fire them for — I signed that a year and a half ago. For many years, you weren't able to do that."
4311,2020-04-05,"So the VA is working. And I was just told by our great leader at the VA, Robert — Robert Wilkie — he said, for the first time, we got the highest marks in the history — highest poll numbers in the history of the Veterans Administration. It came out a week ago that — that they're happy."
4312,2020-04-05,"And, look, one of the reasons that happened — highest in history. One of the reasons that happened is because of Veterans Choice. If they have to wait on line, they go and see a private doctor and we pay the bill. And — and they get better. They don't have to wait two weeks and three weeks or two days. But they get better. And a lot of times, they waited so long that they would they would have a problem and it would end up being terminal because they couldn't get the kind of treatment that they deserve."
4313,2020-04-05,"So, highest poll numbers, highest approval numbers in the history of the VA. I was just given that information yesterday."
4314,2020-04-05,"We restricted visitors' access to 135 veteran community living centers which house nearly 8,000 veterans with chronic medical conditions so that we limit their exposure to the virus. We want to totally take care of our veterans. And that's what we're doing."
4315,2020-04-05,"The VA has canceled most elective medical and surgical procedures. They're delaying them until after this is gone, after we've won."
4316,2020-04-05,"We began providing lifesaving care to patients who had symptoms across the 171 VA medical centers nationwide. That's a big deal. Under my administration, the VA has also been a leader in expanding telehealth. Telehealth is becoming a bigger and bigger factor in medicine."
4317,2020-04-05,"This month, we have taken bold action to cut through the red tape and make telehealth available for millions more Americans during this crisis. They can speak to a doctor from the safety of their home rather than risk becoming infected or make it a tremendously long trip when, frankly, you'll speak to a great doctor right from your home. It's happening: telehealth. We're very much at the forefront of that, too. We're very proud of it, and it also takes a big burden off our system."
4318,2020-04-05,We continue to accelerate the development of safe and effective vaccines. We're also aggressively investigating a number of antiviral therapies and treatments to determine their potential in reducing the severity and duration of the symptoms.
4319,2020-04-05,"And you know how I feel because how I feel is, on Tuesday, they're going to be starting it on Tuesday morning and we're going to have some medications delivered that — we're going to see if they work. They certainly are effective in other ways. And they — they are safe, from the standpoint — is that they're not — they're not killing people. We're not going to have that. So, a lot of great things have been happening in that regard."
4320,2020-04-05,"I just want to finish, and then we're going to ask a couple of people to say a few words that have been so much in the forefront of this incredible job that we've all been given."
4321,2020-04-05,"But I want to say that I know that this is a challenging time for all Americans. We're enduring a great national trial, and we will prove that we can meet the moment."
4322,2020-04-05,"I want to assure the American people that we're doing everything we can each day to confront and ultimately defeat this horrible, invisible enemy. We're at war. In a true sense, we're at war. And we're fighting an invisible enemy. Think of that."
4323,2020-04-05,"For those of you who are feeling alone and isolated, I want you to know that we are all joined together as one people, eternally linked by our shared national spirit — we love our country — a spirit of courage and love and patriotism. No American is alone as long as we are united. And we are united. We're very united. People are saying things now that, three weeks ago, they didn't talk that way. We're very united."
4324,2020-04-05,"No force is equal to the strength of a uni- — really, a unified America, a united America, an America like we have it right now."
4325,2020-04-05,"For those worried and afraid, please know: As long as I am your President, you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you, and I will not stop until we win. This will be a great victory. This is going to be a victory. And it's going to be a victory that, in my opinion, will happen much sooner than originally expected."
4326,2020-04-05,It's now attacking — the enemy is attacking 144 countries at this moment. One hundred and forty-four. That's unthinkable. There's never been anything like this. And it's vicious. It is vicious. Some people recover well and some people have a hard time. We all know that.
4327,2020-04-05,"But we will be totally victorious. We will then get our economy up to a level that it was and, in my opinion, beyond — because there will be a pent-up demand. There is a pent-up demand. And a lot of — a lot of great things will happen."
4328,2020-04-05,"But I'm very proud of our country. I'm very proud. I'm very proud to be your President. And it's just something that's just — you're very special people. So thank you very, very much."
4329,2020-04-05,"And I'm going to ask, if I might, a combination of — Pete, why don't start off, okay? Please."
4330,2020-04-05,Thank you.
4331,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Pete, very much."
4332,2020-04-05,Peter Navarro?
4333,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Peter, very much. Great job."
4334,2020-04-05,"Mike, please."
4335,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Mike, very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mike."
4336,2020-04-05,"So, just a couple of little things, and we'll take some questions. Maybe you will have some, maybe you won't. That'll be a shock. It would shock the American public."
4337,2020-04-05,"But I have to say, on the testing, the new — if we — if this works out, and we think it might, the new test will be a very simple one — much easier than the existing test, which is quite complex and not — not a lot of fun to take. And this will be a game changer."
4338,2020-04-05,"But remember: We inherited a broken, obsolete system. It was good for a small number of people, but not good for the millions of people that we're talking about. And we've made this into a system that, no matter where you go in the world, that's where they're going, that's what they want to do, that's how they're going to be doing it should something like this happen again."
4339,2020-04-05,"So our people have done a fantastic job. Really, a fantastic job. And I hope the new test works out. We'll know fairly soon, I think, Doctor. We're going to be knowing about that fairly soon. Hopefully, it'll check out or test out. And we certainly are looking forward to that. That will be a very simple test by comparison. It won't will be unpleasant at all."
4340,2020-04-05,"And one other thing: the ships. So we have the Mercy, and that's in — it's going to California, as you know. That's in — on the West Coast now. And you have a sister ship that's essentially a twin. They're incredible. I mean, they're incredible ships."
4341,2020-04-05,"I've seen it. I've seen one of them, and they are unbelievable — what they can do and the capacity. Many operating rooms. You know, they're wartime ships. They're meant for war. Many, many operating rooms. Stainless steel. These rooms are as good as there is anywhere in the nation, actually."
4342,2020-04-05,"I spoke with Governor Cuomo. We had a great conversation today — a number of conversations, actually. He's working very hard. And we are going to be bringing that ship — that's called the Comfort. So you have the Mercy and the Comfort. The Comfort is on the East Coast. And that ship will be coming over the next three weeks — three or four weeks. It's being — it was in the middle of maintenance, and we are moving the maintenance very, very quickly. And we're also supplying the ship simultaneously. It's actually big supplies going into those ships — big. And that ship will be coming up here over the next few weeks, and we'll probably be putting it in New York Harbor. And we're making arrangements for that, also, as to where it's going to be docked."
4343,2020-04-05,So you have the Mercy and you have the Comfort. They'll be coming up. The Mercy will start very — very quickly. It'll be arriving in Los Angeles pretty soon. So we look forward to that.
4344,2020-04-05,"A question? ABC, go ahead."
4345,2020-04-05,"Gee, I think it was quite a while ago. I don't know."
4346,2020-04-05,It's been a long time.
4347,2020-04-05,"Who are they, please? Who are they?"
4348,2020-04-05,"Well, I guess Rick is coming out."
4349,2020-04-05,Romney is in isolation?
4350,2020-04-05,"Gee, that's too bad. Go ahead."
4351,2020-04-05,No. No. None whatsoever.
4352,2020-04-05,"I was thinking about it today. And I'm saying — you know, you could have a lot of senators and a lot of House members. I spoke last night with a very, very good man, who happens to be in the House, as you know. And he's — he's just started, and he tested positive."
4353,2020-04-05,"So you could have a large number of people in there from Congress. You could have — between House and Senate, you could have a large number. And I think it's something, at least — I mean, I fully understand why you should be there. I think it may be a constitutional reason why you should. But we could be in a position where I would certainly be in favor of it, where they could vote from a certain outside location. I would be in favor of it."
4354,2020-04-05,"I was thinking about it today. I mean, we could be in this — look, with what's going on — nobody has ever seen anything like this — you could have a lot of people in there from Congress. And it was — it would certainly be — they may tell me there's a reason, constitutionally, and there may be. But I would be totally in favor of it on a temporary basis."
4355,2020-04-05,"Well, we have — we have an interesting thing. You know, we — we all want to get to the same place, but we have different — I have — we want to — and I just wrote this down just a little while ago: We want to protect the worker very much. So do they; so do the Democrats. We also want to protect the worker through their companies. We don't want to necessarily — we're going to help the worker anyway, but ideally they can go back to one of their great companies."
4356,2020-04-05,"You know, you have great companies that are in financial trouble now. And we need money to help those companies so they get back into where they should be — health, you know. Most of these companies, four weeks ago, were having the best year they've ever had. Last year was the best year. Almost all of them — other than Boeing, which has incredibly had problems, big percentage of GDP. But we have to be able to work with Boeing. Boeing is a — was a great company and will be a great company again, I think, shortly. So we have to work with the companies and they don't want to do that. It's crazy. They don't want to do that."
4357,2020-04-05,"I don't want stock buybacks. So I don't know where the problem is there, but I know that's one of the things that they're talking about. I do not want stock buybacks. I don't want to give a bailout to a company and then have somebody go out and use that money to buy back stock in the company and raise the price and then get a bonus. Okay?"
4358,2020-04-05,"So I may be Republican, but I don't like that. I want them to use the money for the workers. I want them to use the money for the company — to help the company. In the airline business, to take care of their planes and all of the things they have to do, including buying new planes. But I don't want — I don't want to have any stock buybacks. The Democrats are with me. I don't know what the problem is on that one because I can't imagine that is too tough."
4359,2020-04-05,"We want to — we want to be able to take care of our people. You're going to have things coming up. We're going to have some of — some of the elements that they're talking about, they're down to — I mean, literally, 95 percent of things that you would think that they wouldn't agree and you'd think the Republicans wouldn't agree to it. And unemployment, as an example, is one of the things they talk about, and unemployment insurance. I think we're very close on that. But, you know, right now, they're not. Right now, they're not there."
4360,2020-04-05,"But I think that the Democrats want to get there. And I can tell you, for a fact, the Republicans want to get there. And I don't think anybody actually has a choice. It's a bold package. It's a big package."
4361,2020-04-05,"We do have money for — one of the things is we do have money for saving small businesses. I don't imagine the Democrats — because we have a lot of money set aside for small businesses. We also have a lot of money set aside for big businesses — you know, the big, powerful companies that were powerful four weeks ago and, today, they're overextended."
4362,2020-04-05,"Look at the cruise lines. That's a big — that's a tremendous business, a big business. Very important to Florida. And it's unthinkable, a month ago. A month — just unthinkable. They were setting all sorts of records. They were — they're building new ships. We can't let the cruise lines go out of business. I mean, that would be massive numbers of jobs for our country and, actually, for the world. But for our country, it's a massive business. And it doesn't take much to keep them going."
4363,2020-04-05,"So we have to — we have to provide for that. But I think both the Democrats and the Republicans are agreed that we have to take care of our workers. And we're going to be doing that in numerous ways, including a substantial cash payment."
4364,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4365,2020-04-05,"Well, it depends which. It depends which governors you're talking about."
4366,2020-04-05,Okay.
4367,2020-04-05,"Well, we are using it now. The fact that I signed it, it's in effect. But, you know, we're a country not based on nationalizing our business. Call a person over in Venezuela; ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out. Not too well. The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept."
4368,2020-04-05,"But I'll tell you why — as Peter said, we may have to use it someplace along the chain, but we're getting calls. Here's the beauty of it: If we go out and we want, let's say, masks, we don't know who to call on masks. But Hanes, who makes things of cotton — various elements, lots of things; it's a great company — they called us and they said, “We're going to make millions of masks.”"
4369,2020-04-05,"We got a call today from 3M — there's a big article today — the head of 3M — they're going to make tremendous products, and they're more or less in that business. And if they're not — like, for instance, General Motors spoke to us; Ford spoke to us about doing ventilators. The beauty is, they're calling us. If you go the national route — nationalization route — we're going to tell a company to make a ventilator; they don't even know what a ventilator is. In the case of one company, they used to make them years ago and they know how to make them. You know, it's a very complex piece of equipment, frankly."
4370,2020-04-05,"So what we're doing is — I think Peter said it maybe better than anybody is going to say it. We have the threat of doing it, if we need it. We may have to use it somewhere along the supply chain, in a minor way. But we have millions of masks being done. We have respirators. We have ventilators. We have a lot of things happening right now. So just the threat of using it."
4371,2020-04-05,"But using it's actually a big deal. I mean, when this was announced, it sent tremors through our business community and through our country because, basically, what are you doing? You're talking about — you're going to nationalize an industry or you're going to nationalize — you're going to take away companies. You're going to tell companies what to do."
4372,2020-04-05,"The truth is, most people — nobody would know where to start. There are companies out there, that you wouldn't think of, that have called us, that say, “We can do ventilators. We used to do them years ago.” And they can do them in large quantities. Other comp- — if I call companies and say, “You build ventilators,” they don't even know what a ventilator is."
4373,2020-04-05,"So it's really working out very well. One of the reasons I read the numbers to you is because we've given vast numbers of just about everything. We've taken it out of our supply — out of our supply, and we're restocking our supply."
4374,2020-04-05,"But we're really backing up the governors. The governors have to go out, do their things. And you have a lot of governors — they've done a fantastic job. You have some that haven't. Usually, it's the ones that complain that have the problems."
4375,2020-04-05,"But we've had a great relationship, as an example, with Governor Cuomo, with Governor Newsom. We've had a great relationship with the State of Washington. Those are the three hotbeds. Those are three hotbeds."
4376,2020-04-05,"Now, we're also dealing with other states, as the Admiral said yesterday. We're dealing with all of the states, actually, in one form or another. Some are very — affected in a very minor way, where you have two people or three people. And I don't even mean deaths; I mean, literally, cases."
4377,2020-04-05,"And that's different than New York, where you have, you know, tremendous — where everybody — I lived there for a long time. Everybody is extremely close, tight. And you have a lot of cases in New York. You have a lot of cases in New York."
4378,2020-04-05,"And we're helping Governor Cuomo. We're helping Governor Newsom. They've been — frankly, they've been total gentlemen. They want to get it done and we want to get it done."
4379,2020-04-05,But doing — doing it the way we're doing it is much better. It's really much better.
4380,2020-04-05,"But it all comes from — yeah, I know."
4381,2020-04-05,You're right.
4382,2020-04-05,"And we coordinate with the states and we are coordinating with the states. And, for the most part, the coordination has been very good."
4383,2020-04-05,"Look, three days ago, I had a phone call with all the governors. I actually allowed the press to stay; they weren't supposed to stay. And one person in the media said, “That was surprising.” It's actually a little risky doing that because we had Democrats and we had Republicans. And, you know, they're politicians and they always have something to say."
4384,2020-04-05,"Well, I took a lot of calls. And we really didn't get one nasty or bad response. They were thanking us for the job we did. And I had the press stand — I don't know if you were there; I don't think so. I had the press standing there, watching. They weren't supposed to be there, but I said, “Let them stand there.”"
4385,2020-04-05,"The governors were very complimentary. Very, very complimentary. And I watched — I watched, over the last few days, Governor Cuomo. I watched Gavin Newsom, in California. I watched both of them. And they've been, you know, very complimentary. And those are really the hotbeds."
4386,2020-04-05,"And so we want to keep that going. I'm very proud of this country. And I'm, frankly, very proud of a lot of the politicians that normally we're fighting with. We have different views, you know — a little different view. But we're going to get to the same place. We have different views, but we're going to get to the same place."
4387,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4388,2020-04-05,"We have been asked about that and we're going to take a look at it. It's a — it's a bit of a problem. But when we talk about totally nonviolent — we're talking about these are “totally nonviolent prisoners.” We are actually looking at that, yes."
4389,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Real quick.
4390,2020-04-05,"Well, I could — I could ask — anybody?"
4391,2020-04-05,"Would you like to take that one, Bob? But, you know, this is just like all of the other stuff that you — not you, but that the press was asking — all of which turned out to be — we actually gave CDC more money, not less money. They said we defunded. It turned out it was more money. Every one of those things that were said were 100 percent wrong, and this sounds like another one them."
4392,2020-04-05,"But, anyway, go ahead."
4393,2020-04-05,"I wish — again, our relationship with China is a very good relationship. I wish they told us three months sooner that this was a problem. We didn't know about it. They knew about it and they should have told us. We could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world. If you look at what's happening in Italy and Spain and a lot of other countries, we could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world."
4394,2020-04-05,Kelly.
4395,2020-04-05,"Well, I hope we won't have to. It's possible, but we'll have to see how that works."
4396,2020-04-05,"As far as the Senate is concerned, we are looking at some — you know, some of the folks are feeling very good. Some are quarantined but they're negative. They may be — it may be totally fine. Okay? Others are positive. We're just finding this now for the first time. I mean, over the last two days, we found out."
4397,2020-04-05,"No, I don't see any threats at all. Honestly, I don't see any threats at all. It'll all work out."
4398,2020-04-05,"It is a question and a very good question, I thought, that we are considering. Now, I don't know if you can do it constitutionally, but we are considering letting people vote — senators, congressmen and women — vote from a separate — from a separate location, from an outside — namely, a hospital or a home, depending on where they are."
4399,2020-04-05,So we are looking at that. It's a little trickier question — most people would believe — but we are looking at that very strongly.
4400,2020-04-05,"Well, we're dealing with him all the time. And we're dealing with Mitch. We're dealing with the other side. Everybody wants to get there. We'll see what happens. I think he'll — I think he'll get there."
4401,2020-04-05,"It's — to me, it's not very complicated. We have to help the worker. We have to save the companies. Because as soon as we're finished with this war — it's not a battle; it's a war — as soon as we're finished with this war, our country is going to bounce back like you've never seen before."
4402,2020-04-05,"But we have to get it to that position and we have to make sure that those companies are whole — that they haven't been disbanded. Because if you do that, it's going to take much longer. So, in a way, it's being pennywise if you don't."
4403,2020-04-05,"But we want to help the worker. We want to help the companies that the workers come from. Because if those companies go out of business — and that includes small businesses. We have a tremendous amount of small business work in there. You know that. Once they go out and they don't come back, that's a much longer period of building."
4404,2020-04-05,Bad things were happening to her in a certain country. And we're — we're really under the feeling that we should keep it somewhat private until —
4405,2020-04-05,"She's already been freed. And I have to tell you, General Milley and the — his people were unbelievable. They were not playing games. General Milley does not play games. He's a very interesting guy. They got her out. They got her out of a certain country where she was seriously abused, accosted, and — whatever the maximum word is, other than death, that happened. But we got her out and she's okay, and she's back with her parents."
4406,2020-04-05,Yes.
4407,2020-04-05,"No, I mean —"
4408,2020-04-05,"Look, I have the best people in the world. I think we're doing an extraordinary job. If you look at — if you look in, let's say, the H1N1 — you look at that whole — that was a disaster. That was a tough period of time for our country. You look at so many other things that weren't handled very well, whether it's Katrina or something else."
4409,2020-04-05,"Look, I respect everybody, but I feel I have an incredible team and I think we're doing an incredible job. When you look at the job we're doing — and all you have to do is look at the approval numbers on the job we're doing. I think we're doing an incredible job."
4410,2020-04-05,"So I don't want to disturb them, bother them. I don't think I'm going to learn much. And, you know, I guess you could say that there's probably a natural inclination not to call."
4411,2020-04-05,"Now, if I felt that if I called, I'd learn something and that would say one life — it would save one life, okay? — I would make the call in two minutes. But I don't see that happening."
4412,2020-04-05,Please.
4413,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4414,2020-04-05,"Sure. Sure. Well, look, I'm of the opinion we have to do great during this 14 days, during the 15-day period. We'll know at the end of 14 days, pretty much. We're going to have a pretty good idea how we're doing."
4415,2020-04-05,"I think you have to shut it down and you have to see. But, you know, there'll be a point at which we say, “We're back in business. Let's go.”"
4416,2020-04-05,"Those two statements are not mutually exclusive, you understand. I saw both of them today."
4417,2020-04-05,And they sort of — they intermesh.
4418,2020-04-05,"Well, he — he is calling for a faster — just a brutal shutdown, and then open up, maybe, a little bit faster. So, you know, there's — there's that fine line."
4419,2020-04-05,"Look, we did a big shutdown when we wouldn't allow people from China that could have been very seriously infected, that were — when we cut that off very early. And then we cut Europe off very early, as you know. So that was also very early."
4420,2020-04-05,"Well, I can't tell you that. What I have to say is that I think we're going to have good results. I think the American people have been amazing. I think our stimulus package will get done, and it will be a tremendous package. We're really not — I mean, they may not have gotten those votes but they're very close to getting a deal done. So I'd be — I'd be surprised if I didn't."
4421,2020-04-05,"And if they don't, I think, frankly, the American people will be very upset with the Democrats because the Republicans are ready to approve a deal. So the only reason that the deal couldn't get done is pure politics."
4422,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
4423,2020-04-05,"Well, he should have — you know, the hospital systems, in various places — some have been stocked and ready to go for — nothing for this. Nothing. This is beyond anything that anybody ever thought possible. I think you could really say this."
4424,2020-04-05,"Nobody can — nobody can really — Doctor, nobody can really say, “Oh, gee, this will happen.” This is a very unique and hopefully it will be unique for, you know, many, many centuries — you know, for a long time. Hopefully we don't see this again."
4425,2020-04-05,"But, again, the systems are supposed to be ready, willing, and able. They're supposed to be ready to go. We are helping them a lot, and I have great love for New York City and I have great love for New York State. And we're going to help them a lot."
4426,2020-04-05,"I mean, I was just saying we're sending our ships up there; we're sending more than just this ship. We may be using — if we need, we'll be using some of the cruise ships that you've been reading about. We'll be using them also because they're very immediate and very quick. They can be there very quickly. We have good docking sys- — you know, systems in the places that we're talking about. So we may be using some of the cruise liners that we're talking about."
4427,2020-04-05,"But, no. I mean, I think — I think Bill de Blasio is working very hard. I think he's trying very hard. It's a tough situation for him and every mayor because nobody has ever seen the scale. You know, when you hear — you've given millions of masks and you've given hundreds of thousands of masks in a certain short period of time, and then you hear they need many, many more."
4428,2020-04-05,"You know, one of the things they have started, with respect to masks, is the sterilization process. Some are — you know, are — really, it works very well. Others aren't really set up that way; you throw them out. But we have a sterilization process that's working very hard."
4429,2020-04-05,"Speaking of that, hand sanitizers: You know, when you asked the question on the companies and what's going on — we have many companies now — companies that made whiskey, they'd made alcohol, they've now gone very quickly into the hand sanitizers and all of — you know, you've been reading about it. Three or four big companies. We're doing incredibly well on that."
4430,2020-04-05,"There was no way, if you took the existing companies, that something like that could happen. But it happens almost — they'll call Peter Navarro or they'll call somebody. In one case, they called me. They said, “We can do this. We can do that.” We've had a lot of those calls where companies want to — there's a company in New Hampshire, a great company — they want to make ventilators. I had never thought of them for ventilators, but they do make metal equipment and things out of metal. They'll be great. They'll make — they'll make a great product."
4431,2020-04-05,"So, Peter, I think you're seeing a lot of that. Right?"
4432,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
4433,2020-04-05,"Well, you know, every time I do it — like, for instance, I committed publicly that I wouldn't take the $450,000 salary. It's a lot of money. Whether you're rich or not, it's a lot of money. And I did it and nobody cared. Nobody — nobody said, “Thank you.” Nobody said, “Thank you very much.”"
4434,2020-04-05,"Now, I didn't commit legally. I just said, “I don't want it. I don't want my salary. I work for zero. I don't want my salary.” Nobody said, “Oh, thank you very much.” But I guarantee you, if I ever took it, you would go out after me — you, in particular, would go out after me like crazy."
4435,2020-04-05,"So I have no idea what they're talking about with regard to the one element. Everything is changing, just so you understand. It's all changing. But I have no idea. But every time I commit to do something — I've committed to do my — look, I ran and everybody knew I was a rich person. I built a great company and people knew that. But I agreed to do things I didn't have to. I still don't have to."
4436,2020-04-05,"But my company — I told the kids, who are running it — I'm not running it. But I told them, “Don't deal with foreign companies. Don't deal...” I didn't have to do that. I could have just ran and I have — I didn't have to do that at all. And instead of being thanked for, again, not agreeing to do, but just not doing it, I get excoriated all the time."
4437,2020-04-05,"So I've learned — let's just see what happens because we have to save some of these great companies. They can be great companies, literally, in a matter of weeks. We have to save them."
4438,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4439,2020-04-05,Yeah. Go ahead. Sure.
4440,2020-04-05,"Pete, go ahead."
4441,2020-04-05,Sure.
4442,2020-04-05,"If we need them. I don't — I hope we don't need them. I hope you're going to have great luck on Tuesday morning. We sent a lot of the medicine — we don't have to go into it again, but we sent a lot of the medicine to Governor Cuomo. I believe they already have it. And they have some very capable people. We spoke to Dr. Zucker, who is his primary representative on this. And we spoke to the governor himself, and I think he's excited about it like I'm excited about it. Now, will it work? I think it has a really good chance. I think it's worthwhile."
4443,2020-04-05,"Why should we be testing it in a test tube for a year and a half, when we have thousands of people that are very sick? They're very, very sick. And we can use it on those people and maybe make them better — and, in some cases, maybe save their lives."
4444,2020-04-05,"So, Governor Cuomo told me they'll be using their supplies — starting their supply on Tuesday morning. I think it's very exciting. I think — because, if that happens, much of what we're talking about with ships and hospitals and all of the things that we're doing and all of these masks and everything that we're ordering — ventilators — it's a whole different game if that happens. And we'll see."
4445,2020-04-05,"There's been some tremendous signs that this could work. Now, again, you know, some doctors think it should go for years in testing. But, you know, this has been something that's been around for many years. It's been phenomenal — a strong, powerful drug for malaria. But we think it might work on this, based on evidence — based on very strong evidence. We're going to see. We're going to know on — you know, sometime after Tuesday."
4446,2020-04-05,"But you'll have to ask Governor Cuomo. I think they're going to start the process. We've gotten them the drug. I think they're going to start the process of giving the drug — mouth — you know, through — through mouth. And I think that starts on Tuesday morning, he said. And that'll be — I mean, I tell you what: I don't want to get anybody overly excited, but I'm very excited by that, by the prospect of it."
4447,2020-04-05,"Then, in addition to that, they're working — NIH is working on vaccines and on — they're making great progress, but the vaccine does have to be tested for a long period of time because you can't give, you know, thousands — millions of people a vaccine and it turns out to be dangerous. So that does have to be tested."
4448,2020-04-05,"But this one has been taken for a long time, so we know pretty much one result."
4449,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4450,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't want to exactly say that, but I have spoken to President Xi about this — specifically, about this. And, look, he doesn't want this. This was — you know, this is not something that he wants, and — and it happened. It happened to China."
4451,2020-04-05,"And one thing they told me — I was told by our great Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, that China has been buying a lot of our farm product. And I'm looking at different pricing, but China has, despite all of this. And it started — this delayed it a little bit, obviously, but it started fairly recently. But China is buying — we made a new deal, as you know, with China. A very big trade deal. And China has been buying our agricultural product."
4452,2020-04-05,"Yes. In fact, they're sending some masks —"
4453,2020-04-05,They're sending masks to Italy. They are sending masks to Italy. We're in a very good process with masks.
4454,2020-04-05,"But I'm a little upset with China, I'll be honest with you, because —"
4455,2020-04-05,"— as much as I like President Xi and as much as I respect the country and admire the country — I have great admiration for the country, what they've done in a short period of time. Of course, our presidents, our previous presidents allowed that to happen; you should say “thank you very much” to all of them."
4456,2020-04-05,"But they should have told us about this. And I did ask him whether or not we could send some people, and they didn't want that — out of pride. I think, really, out of pride. They don't want — they don't want us sending people into China, to help them. You know, China is a strong country. They have — they have their scientists and they have their doctors — very smart. A lot of people."
4457,2020-04-05,"And, you know, but I did discuss that about sending our people in. And, they didn't really respond. We went again; they didn't respond. If they went in, they would have been able to tell us — give us a much earlier indication. But we had an early indication, and that's why I closed out China. I mean, I felt — it was my instinct, but that's why I closed out China at a very early time."
4458,2020-04-05,Please.
4459,2020-04-05,It's really a fair question. I think I'll let — would you like to answer that question? Please.
4460,2020-04-05,"Please, Surgeon General."
4461,2020-04-05,Yes.
4462,2020-04-05,"I'll answer that. And if that's not the policy, I'll make it the policy. And I was just saying, as Mike was saying that, the answer is “yes.” We will do those tests, because I think, in that case, it's important."
4463,2020-04-05,"I think that if you could call — you could say “illegal alien”; you could say, “illegal immigrant”; you could say whatever you want to use — your definition of what you're talking about. We're all talking about the same thing. Yes, we will test that person because I think it's important that we test that person. And we don't want to send that person back into wherever we're going to be sending the person — whether it's another country or someplace else. Because, you know, we're now bringing them right out of our country."
4464,2020-04-05,"But, yeah, we will test those people. Okay? Thank you."
4465,2020-04-05,Yeah. Please.
4466,2020-04-05,Please.
4467,2020-04-05,Do you need a test?
4468,2020-04-05,"He better not, right? He better not."
4469,2020-04-05,He didn't like it.
4470,2020-04-05,He wasn't happy. (Laughter.)
4471,2020-04-05,"And, you know, anybody that knows Karen Pence knows this — because the Vice President told me. He said she actually handled it better than him. (Laughter.) Right?"
4472,2020-04-05,"That's true, right? I didn't handle it — I didn't handle it so well, either. Don't worry about it."
4473,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
4474,2020-04-05,Yeah. With numerous countries. Yeah.
4475,2020-04-05,"Sure. With numerous countries. If they need help, we'll give them help. There's nobody has what we have, especially with the new tests that are coming out. North Korea, Iran, by the way, and others. We are open for helping other countries. And this is a very serious time and North Korea is going through something."
4476,2020-04-05,"Iran is going through something very, very strong. We let — Iran is really going through a very difficult period with respect to this, as you know."
4477,2020-04-05,"So I've put the — it's really a glad hand, it's all it is, to North Korea, to Iran, and to many other countries. And we're working with — as the Doctor can say, we're working with many countries, with respect to the problems that they have. Again, it's over 140 countries right now. But North Korea, Iran, and many of the countries, we will help and we're willing to."
4478,2020-04-05,"As an example, this new test — if this new test works out where, instead of going through what we all went through with this rather difficult test, to put it nicely, we would have — is that just a swab on the tongue, Doctor? Just a — or, how does that work, the —"
4479,2020-04-05,Not to the same — not to the same —
4480,2020-04-05,"It doesn't go all the way and hangs a right under your eye, right? (Laughter.) So, that's a tough test."
4481,2020-04-05,"So, if we do that — the procedure, the test — and nobody has this in the world. Nobody has this. This is developed by us. We think it's going to be certified soon. We think it's going to be very good. But if we have that, we'll be able to help a lot of countries."
4482,2020-04-05,Please.
4483,2020-04-05,We're going to with everybody and see if we can get something done.
4484,2020-04-05,Please.
4485,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we'll work with whoever we have to. We have to help the American worker. We have to help the countries from which the American workers — I mean, they came out of these companies — they were doing phenomenally well. You saw where payroll was going way up, where wages were going way, way up. There's never been a time like this."
4486,2020-04-05,"We can't lose those companies and we want the worker to be happy. And we're being, I think, more generous than anybody has ever been. We want to take care of the worker, but we want to make sure that when we win the war — it's only a question of — it's “when,” not “if.” When we win the war against the virus, we want to make sure those companies are ready to charge forward — not that they've been disbanded because we were pennywise and dollar foolish."
4487,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4488,2020-04-05,"Well, we were asked that question a little while ago and the answer is: We may, but we may not need it. We do a very high standard — our standard is higher."
4489,2020-04-05,Please.
4490,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4491,2020-04-05,"We're going to see what happens. Hopefully, we won't need it, but we might. But we're going to see what happens."
4492,2020-04-05,"Look, the greatest thing we can do is win the war. The war is against the virus. That's the war. We do that, everything — I really believe everything is going to fall into place. It's going to be beautiful. I call it a “pent-up demand.” People are dying to go out to a restaurant. People are dying to go onto airplanes. They're — I think, we're going to — there's a tremendous pent-up demand. You may be surprised to the degree."
4493,2020-04-05,I think it's going to go very rapidly because this wasn't a financial crisis — just the opposite. This was a medical crisis.
4494,2020-04-05,"No, I don't have stock. I own things that —"
4495,2020-04-05,"No. I didn't even think about it. You know, it's very interesting that you ask a question like that — you know, a nasty question. And yet, it deserves to asked, I guess."
4496,2020-04-05,"What I've done, by deciding to run — and I knew this. I knew this the first day. I said, “If I win, it's going to going to cost a lot of money.” It cost me billions of dollars to become President — to be President of the United States — in things that would normally be run at a certain thing, even people that don't like me because they think I'm too tough on the border. Now, some people love me for it; other people don't like me at all. You know, it's very funny."
4497,2020-04-05,"My wife — we were at a charity event in New York City. I had just announced that I was running. And we were at the Robin Hood Foundation at the Convention Center — which now we're going to be converting to hospitals for Governor Cuomo, right? And I was walking in and there was a smattering of boos and a smattering of cheers; I was getting both. And our very popular First Lady — she's turned out to be very popular –people have great respect for her. But our very popular First Lady said to me, “Huh, that's strange. I've never heard anybody booing you.”"
4498,2020-04-05,"That was very early on — because I think I called for strong borders or I called for something that other people don't like, you know. And I knew this would happen. I knew it was going to happen. But the fact that I ran — and I knew as soon as I announced. When I ran, I said, “It's going to cost me a fortune.” Not only in terms of actual costs — look at my legal costs. You people, everybody — everybody is suing me. I'm being sued by people that I never even heard of. I'm being sued all over the place — and doing very well, but it's unfair."
4499,2020-04-05,"But I'll say this: In terms of running for President — and I don't think rich people — Michael Bloomberg spent now, it was determined, almost a billion dollars and look what happened. I think it's very hard for rich people to run for office. It's — it's far more costly. It's just a — it's a very tough thing."
4500,2020-04-05,"Now, with all of that being said, I'm so glad I've done it. Because, you know, there are a lot rich people around. I've got a lot of rich friends, but they can't help and they can't do what I've done, in terms of helping this country. We are — we are doing things. We got sidetracked by the invisible enemy."
4501,2020-04-05,"But, you know — what — when you look at what we've done, I said before, with the veterans, with — with all of the things we've done, especially Choice. But when you look at all of — Accountability — when you look at all of the things that we've done — rebuilding the military; the tax cuts, which — thank goodness we had the tax cuts because we had cushion. Oh, without that, this would have been catastrophic. We had a big cushion."
4502,2020-04-05,"I mean, with all of the losses that you've seen in the stock market, we're basically back — and with this horrible thing, if this would have happened before, you would have had nothing left. This was all cushion."
4503,2020-04-05,"But I will say that it cost me billions of dollars to be President, and especially with all the money I could have made for the last three, four years — and I didn't because I was being President. I have no interest in it."
4504,2020-04-05,"I'm allowed to. You know, I don't know if you know it — George Washington, they say he was a rich man, supposedly. Relatively rich. And he ran the presidency and he also ran his business. They say he had two desks."
4505,2020-04-05,"Nobody complained until I came along. I got elected as a rich person, but nobody complained until I came along. So it cost me billions of dollars to be President and I am so happy I did it. Because who cares? Who cares?"
4506,2020-04-05,"I'm really happy with the job we're doing. And I'm glad that this team and me are here for this horrible thing. I mean, it's — a number of people have said it, but — and I feel it, actually: I'm a wartime president. This is a war. This is a war. A different kind of war than we've ever had."
4507,2020-04-05,"And when you look at the economics of the war — in the past, we used to stimulate to get people jobs. Now we're stimulating to protect people because we don't want them to work, because we want them to stay away from each other. We don't want them to gather. Social — social gathering. So we're paying billions of dollars more than that so that they don't gather, they don't — because we have to defeat this virus. And we will."
4508,2020-04-05,But it cost me billions and billions of dollars to be President and I am so happy I did it.
4509,2020-04-05,Go ahead. How about you?
4510,2020-04-05,"Well, we do help foreign countries. I mean, that was the other question."
4511,2020-04-05,And I'm honored to help. And the doctor has helped. The Surgeon General is speaking to other countries all the time. They're asking him questions: “What do we do?” Nobody has ever seen anything like this. They're calling our people all of the time.
4512,2020-04-05,"And, yes, I have let it be known that we'll help people, including North Korea, including Iran, and including many other countries. It's very important to do that."
4513,2020-04-05,"So — no, not in the stimulus bill, but we are very much — I mean, we give away billions of dollars for, as an example, AIDS in Africa. We're still fighting that battle. It's a tremendous battle. A tremendous war, also. But we're fighting it here, as you know. In 10 years — now it's eight years, because I started it. It should've been started before — long before I got here because they had the answer even before. But we're fighting that battle. We'll be AIDS-free in approximately eight years. It looks like that is going to happen. We're spending a lot of money."
4514,2020-04-05,"But we're spending a lot of money with other countries. If you look at the aid that we give to other countries, we give billions and billions and billions of dollars to other countries. And a lot of times, I say, “You know, we could save a lot of money. We shouldn't...” And then, they come in. I say, “What's it used for?” “It's used to fight malaria in countries that are very poor. It's used to fight AIDS in Africa. It's used to fight many other things.” Many other things. And I don't think I've ever said, “No.” I can't. It's just so terrible."
4515,2020-04-05,"Countries that we have really — we're not involved with them very much, other than there would be tremendous death. Tremendous death. I mean, you could get a list — and I could get you a list. We give away billions of dollars to other countries."
4516,2020-04-05,"And we are giving away a lot, in terms of everything, and probably will end up doing — economically, doing something for other countries."
4517,2020-04-05,"But when I'm presented with these lists –that, “Yes, sir, in Africa, we're fighting AIDS” or we're fighting something else — I'll tell you what, I start off by saying, “You know, we should save — we could save a lot of money.” And then, by the time they walked those lists into my office, I say, “We have to keep doing that.” That's humanity you're talking —"
4518,2020-04-05,"How about one more question? Yes, please."
4519,2020-04-05,"Well, states have to call — that's a great governor. You're talking about Greg Abbott in Texas. And he's a great governor and he knows what he's doing."
4520,2020-04-05,"A lot of the areas that he's talking about — a lot of the counties he's talking about are not very strongly affected. You know, it's a very different kind of a place and a great place. But I have total confidence in Governor Greg Abbott."
4521,2020-04-05,I'll do one more. Go ahead.
4522,2020-04-05,"Yeah, sure. Because it's — every state is different. Every state is different. I mean, Idaho, West Virginia, Iowa, Nebraska are much different than New York, than California — Los Angeles, as an example, or San Francisco. They're much different. I mean, it's — it's much different."
4523,2020-04-05,"The hotspots right now are State of Washington and — probably, number one, by far, right now is New York. That's the hotspot like no other hotspot. And California is a hotspot, but New York right now is the leader. There's no question."
4524,2020-04-05,All right. Final question.
4525,2020-04-05,"Well, that's a lawsuit coming out of Texas. Again, that was headed up by Texas. And what we want to do is get rid of the bad healthcare and put in a great healthcare. And we will always — I will say this, I can make this commitment to you: The Republican Party is fully backing preexisting conditions."
4526,2020-04-05,"Now if we could get a great healthcare plan, which would need the House to do — but if we can get a great healthcare plan, we will only do it if we have preexisting conditions totally backed. So, we're backing preexisting, but we'd like to get rid of bad healthcare."
4527,2020-04-05,"Now, we are running the bad healthcare much better than it was ever run and we're making it better, but it could be much better than it is. And so what we want to do is terminate it, have a great healthcare, but we will only do it with preexisting. We will back preexisting conditions."
4528,2020-04-05,Okay. Thank you all very much. Thank you. We'll be back. We'll have a meeting tomorrow. Thank you.
4529,2020-04-05,"It was Mario. Oh, did — well, Jose — I watched Jose on NBC the other night."
4530,2020-04-05,Okay? Mario.
4531,2020-04-05,Thank you very much. Great to have you. And thank you all for being here. My administration is taking new action to ensure that America has the medical resources and equipment needed to fight the global pandemic. It's been a brutal pandemic for over 150 countries all over the world.
4532,2020-04-05,"We've had great success over the last month. We've — as you know, the millions and millions of pieces of equipment have been delivered successfully by us — purchased and delivered. And we've made it available to the states. And the governors have been very gracious for the most part, I would say. There are a couple that aren't appreciative of the incredible job. They have to do a better job themselves; that's part of the problem."
4533,2020-04-05,"But, generally speaking, I have to tell you the governors have been great. I just spoke to the governor of New Jersey, Governor Murphy, and he's very thankful. And Governor Cuomo has been very nice. They've — they've really appreciated, I think, what the federal government has done. You look at the hospitals that are being built all over the country by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA; it's been really incredible. Nobody has seen — they'll build hospitals in two or three days — portable hospitals."
4534,2020-04-05,"This afternoon, I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators. Ventilators are a big deal and we've delivered thousands of them. And oftentimes, you don't need ventilators very much. Hospitals don't have very many. And now we're — turning out that we have to produce large numbers. But we've been able to do that and we're going to be doing a lot more."
4535,2020-04-05,"This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis. We thought that we had to deal with, as an example, General Motors. And I guess they thought otherwise; they didn't agree. And now they do. They do agree. And I think we might be able to pull it. But we let them know the way we felt, and they can't be doing that."
4536,2020-04-05,"We'll work in partnership with the private sector, but where an emergency exists — and it's very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly — we will do what we have to do and immediately exercise all available lawful authorities to get the job done."
4537,2020-04-05,"This afternoon, I also signed an executive order investing — and very, very strongly investing — the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security with the full authorities available under the Defense Production Act to respond to the outbreak of the terrible virus — the “invisible enemy,” as we say."
4538,2020-04-05,"My order also establishes that Peter Navarro — a very trusted person from the White House, and he's been an incredible — he's done an incredible job for me in terms of negotiation, in terms of understanding where the world is going, economically. But my order establishes that Peter will serve as National Defense Production Act Policy Coordinator for the federal government. That's a very important position — more important, probably, than it's almost ever been in our country."
4539,2020-04-05,"And so I want to congratulate Peter and his family. It's — I know he's going to do a fantastic job. He's been doing that job over the last few weeks. Peter has a PhD in economics from Harvard; has a master in public administration from the Kennedy School, also from Harvard. And he's a tremendous guy and he will do a fantastic job."
4540,2020-04-05,"But I'd like to maybe ask, before I continue, Peter to say a few words, please. Peter? Thank you very much."
4541,2020-04-05,They can't tell them much.
4542,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Thank you, Peter, and good luck."
4543,2020-04-05,"My administration is marshalling the full power of the American government, and we will do that, and that's what we've done, and we will continue to do it until our war is won. Economic, scientific, medical, military, and homeland security — all of this to vanquish the virus."
4544,2020-04-05,"We are working to sign contracts immediately with the major ventilator companies in the country, including GE, Philips, Medtronic, Hamilton, ZOLL, RedMed [ResMed], Hillrom, and Vyaire. These are all companies that do this — great companies."
4545,2020-04-05,"The FDA will be reducing and waiving unnecessary regulations in order to get this done. We're going to be getting rid of certain, let's say, barriers to speed. We want them to get it done quickly. They've been doing it for a long time. They've been making ventilators for a long time. Hopefully, General Motors will join in the fray."
4546,2020-04-05,"Under the normal condition that you would be — regular times — 29,000 ventilators are distributed in the United States each year. In the next 100 days — well, first of all, we've already delivered thousands of them — but within the next 100 days, we will either make or get, in some form, over 100,000 additional units. And I guess, to put it in other words, in the next 100 days, we'll receive over three times the number of ventilators made during a regular year in the United States, and that doesn't include all of the thousands and thousands that we've — we've given to the various states, a lot of them."
4547,2020-04-05,"We delivered thousands, as you know, to New York and they didn't know they got them. And then we also had thousands put in a warehouse, and that was also for New York. And they just found out that they were there, so we have to make sure that when we deliver things, they get distributed."
4548,2020-04-05,"Earlier today, I spoke to the CEO of Boeing, Dave Calhoun. And Boeing will be producing and donating face shields to help our medical professionals on the frontlines. These are actually pretty intricate, in terms of the plastic and the quality of the materials. They're important. They've got to be top of the line and they're going to do thousands of these a week. They've already tested the production and they're ready to begin producing all of these shields. That's the plastic shields that go over the face."
4549,2020-04-05,"Boeing is also offering us the use of their — what they call the Dreamlifter cargo plane. It's the largest plane in the world. And this is sort of a picture of it. They called up just a little while ago. And that can sort of take anything. That's the biggest in the world. And they're letting us use that for the distribution of product all over the country, especially the heavy product or large quantities of product."
4550,2020-04-05,"And Boeing will dedicate up to three planes to the mission of flying medical supplies anywhere we need it. Each plane can carry 63,000 pounds of cargo per flight. That's a lot of cargo."
4551,2020-04-05,"I also signed an executive order giving the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security the authority to activate the Ready Reserve components of the armed forces. This will allow us to mobilize medical disaster and emergency response personnel to help wage our battle against the virus by activating thousands of experienced service members, including retirees."
4552,2020-04-05,"We have a lot of people — retirees; great, great military people — they're coming back in — who have offered to support the nation in this extraordinary time of need. And they come back in. They don't say, “How much?” They don't say, “What are we getting paid?” They just want to come back in. It's really an incredible thing to see. It's beautiful."
4553,2020-04-05,"This afternoon, I also signed into law $2.2 trillion in urgently needed relief for our nation's families, workers, businesses, and Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. And the $2.2 trillion goes to $6.2 trillion, depending on need. So it's the largest — it's the largest bill ever signed — and not just emergency relief, but of any kind. We've never signed a bill of that magnitude."
4554,2020-04-05,"And, you know, incredibly, it was 96 to nothing in the Senate and it was essentially the same thing in Congress. They did it very quickly in the House. They did it very, very quickly. So, if you look at Congress — what they've been able to do — the House was a voice vote, I guess they would call it, and something like that rarely takes place. And 96 to nothing in the Senate for the largest bill in the history of our country. That's pretty good."
4555,2020-04-05,"And I want to thank Republicans, I want to thank Democrats for coming together for the whole of the nation. And this is a great thing, a great victory. This is going to save companies that are incredible companies, but that are going to need some help because of what happened. A month ago, they were outstanding. They were having the best year they ever had and then we got hit. And so, we'll help them out. It's thousands and millions of jobs. It's millions of jobs. And I just want to thank everybody for working so hard, and that includes the people standing with me right here."
4556,2020-04-05,"The legislation extends a vital lifeline to American families and American workers with job retention loans for small businesses — and a big focus of the bill is small businesses. They're really the — they're the energy. They're whatever you want to call it, in terms of our nation. They push. People have no idea how big a factor — Peter can tell you — the small businesses are in this country, from an economic standpoint, from a job standpoint."
4557,2020-04-05,"We expand the unemployment benefits for workers very substantially and direct-cash payments will be going to American citizens — substantial. This legislation also provides a massive increase in funding for hospitals for the Disaster Relief Fund and critical supplies, including masks, respirators, and pharmaceuticals of all types. And, speaking of pharmaceuticals, as you know, we're working vaccines. We're getting some good response and we're working on therapeutics and cures. And we have some very interesting things happening."
4558,2020-04-05,"This afternoon, Apple launched a new tool created in partnership with our task force, the CDC, and FEMA. Any individual who is concerned that they might have the virus can now download the free COVID-19 app on their iPhone and answer a set of simple questions about their symptoms and risk factors. It's getting to be a very modernized system, indeed. They'll soon receive HHS recommendations on what to do next, including whether they should get tested or not. And again, we only want people to get tested if they — if we think they need it."
4559,2020-04-05,"In a few moments, Secretary DeVos and Secretary Perdue will discuss new partnerships with the private sector that are providing meals to millions of students while schools are closed. They've both been incredible, the job they've done. I appreciate them very much."
4560,2020-04-05,"We're grateful for the assistance of Niren Chaudhary, CEO of Panera Bread Company. They've been so incredible to us and to the people of our country. And Denton McLane, Chairman of McLane Global Logistics. And they've joined us — they're onstage with me. They're going to speak."
4561,2020-04-05,"Throughout this ordeal, I have been awed and inspired by the American people more than anything else, more than anyone else. Americans of every walk of life have followed the guidelines, shown incredible compassion, and sacrificed greatly on behalf of their fellow citizens. I want every American to know that their selfless and heroic actions are saving lives. And I want them to know, and I've said it before, that I'm very proud to be their President. I'm very proud of the American people."
4562,2020-04-05,"My administration is actively planning the next phase in an all-out war against this horrible virus. We're now testing nearly 100,000 patients per day — more than anybody in the world — and we have now, as of even a couple of weeks ago, tested more than any other country in the world and our capacity continues to grow."
4563,2020-04-05,"Widespread surveillance testing will allow us to monitor the spread of the virus — and we're doing that quite accurately, and Deborah and Tony will be speaking about that; and coordinate with states to contain new hotspots as they arise with a targeted, fact-based and data-bra- — based approach. It's all data driven."
4564,2020-04-05,"This surveillance testing will soon enable us to publish updated guidelines for state and local leaders. We want every county and region in the country to have the on-the-ground evidence that they need to determine the mitigation measures that are right for them. Each location is different. Some are very, very different. Some are day and night. Some are in great shape and some aren't in great shape. And we'll be able to have very accurate information very shortly. We already have a lot of that information."
4565,2020-04-05,"America is bravely battling this pandemic through cutting-edge science, medical innovation, and rational, deliberate, and determined vigilance. No effort will be spared in winning this war. We're going to win the war. Hopefully, we're going to win soon and with as few lives as possible lost. You see what's going on all over the world. You see the lives, you see Italy, you see Spain, you see all of these countries going through so much, going through such hell. And we're all in very strong communication, I can tell you. Our professionals are dealing with them every day, many of the countries. So many countries, but many of the countries, we're dealing very directly and closely."
4566,2020-04-05,"And we're going to be in very good shape, in terms of certain equipment that's very hard to get, very hard to manufacture. And, at the right time, we'll be distributing that equipment throughout the world to other countries. Boris Johnson was asking for ventilators today. As you know, Boris is — he has tested — unfortunately, he has tested positive and that's a terrible thing. But he's going to be great. I'm sure he's going to be totally great. But they want ventilators. Italy wants ventilators. Spain wants ventilators. Germany wants ventilators. They're all calling for ventilators. Well, we're going to make a lot of ventilators. And we'll take care of our needs, but we're also going to help other countries."
4567,2020-04-05,"So I just want to thank everybody. I want to thank our great American citizens. And a lot of incredible things are happening — really happening — and it's too bad. I was saying, before we had the press conference, when we signed — we had a signing ceremony, where we signed the largest bill in our history. And I said, “Think of it: 22 days ago, we had the greatest economy in the world.” Everything was going beautifully, the stock market hit an all-time high again for the over 150th time during my presidency, and the world was looking good. And then we got hit by the invisible enemy and now you have countries all over the world reeling. But we're winning it, and we'll be bigger and better and stronger than we were even before."
4568,2020-04-05,"And we will also have apparatus in place that works. We won't have broken systems. We'll have incredible systems so if this should happen again — and hopefully it won't, but if a thing like it should happen again, we'll be able to handle it very much more easily."
4569,2020-04-05,"So with that, I'll take a few questions. Steve, please?"
4570,2020-04-05,"Well, it got to be a debate over costs and we don't want to think too much about cost when we're talking about this. This is not cost. I wasn't happy where General Motors built plants in other locations over the years, not so much during my term, but they built a lot of plants in other countries; I won't name the countries but you can imagine. And so I didn't go into it with a very favorable view."
4571,2020-04-05,"I was extremely unhappy with Lordstown, Ohio, where they left Lordstown, Ohio, in the middle of an auto boom because we had 17 car companies coming in and then they were leaving one plant in Ohio. I love Ohio. And what happens? That became the story — not that all these plants are moving in, but that you had one plant — they were leaving. And, frankly, I think that would be a good place to build the ventilators, but we'll see. We'll see how that all works out."
4572,2020-04-05,"But — so I wasn't too thrilled. And then we thought we had a deal for 40,000 ventilators and, all of a sudden, it became 6, and then price became a big object."
4573,2020-04-05,But Peter Navarro is going to handle that and Peter will do a very good job. We'll see. Maybe they'll change their tune but we didn't want to play games with them.
4574,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4575,2020-04-05,The quarantine orders.
4576,2020-04-05,"Well, I think I'm going to let Tony speak to that a little bit later, but we're being very strong on quarantine. We're being very strong on people not leaving, especially certain states, and going to other states where they have less of a problem."
4577,2020-04-05,"I mean, you're hearing constantly about people leaving New York and going down to Florida. And New York obviously is a hotspot and that's why we're building all those hospitals in New York and all those medical centers in New York."
4578,2020-04-05,"So we'll let Tony answer that. But specifically, you have to understand, we're not playing games."
4579,2020-04-05,John?
4580,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4581,2020-04-05,"It wasn't after. It was before. And we just were not getting there with General Motors. We weren't getting there. We were getting there with a lot of other companies. And we have the people that are doing it for me in the room right here, and we can have — we can talk to you later about it, but we have to get these people onboard. We're not looking to get into a big deal on price. We're not looking to be ripped off on price. We don't want prices to be double, triple what they should be."
4582,2020-04-05,"So General Motors, we'll see what happens, but now they're talking. But they weren't talking the right way at the beginning, and that was not right to the country."
4583,2020-04-05,"Well, I think there's —"
4584,2020-04-05,"— a very good chance we won't need that many. And I think, frankly, there's a great chance that we're not going to need that many. But you know what? There are a lot of other people that are going to need them. We have countries all over the world that are friends of ours, and we will help those countries. We're in a position to do things that other countries can't."
4585,2020-04-05,"So we have sort of an interesting position. We can make them because we're going to be making over 100,000 pretty quickly. So we can make them. And if we don't need them, John, that's okay because we can help Italy, and we can help UK — Boris Johnson, specifically. I mean, when I say, “How are you feeling?” And the first thing Boris said to me is, “We need ventilators.”"
4586,2020-04-05,"Oh, absolutely. We're not going to be keeping — all over the world, they want them. And we're in a position to make them and other countries aren't. Okay?"
4587,2020-04-05,"Well, if you look — and I think you can ask that question best of Deborah — but I think their estimates are high. I hope they're high. They could be extremely high. We're doing even hospitals based on pretty high estimates. You know, I'm doing them anyway."
4588,2020-04-05,"And, as I told John, if we do not need them, that would be wonderful and we can help a lot of great people all over the world. We can help them live. But I think — I think his estimates are going to be very high. We're going to see."
4589,2020-04-05,"Don't forget, we sent thousands of ventilators to New York, and they didn't know they got them. Then we sent thousands of ventilators to New York — they have a warehouse, a New York warehouse in Edison, New Jersey, which is an interesting thing. And we sent them to Edison, New Jersey. They were in the warehouse, ready to go, and New York never took them. So they knew they were there. So we have to get people lined up, but we've given them —"
4590,2020-04-05,"And I'm not blaming New York. Look, this is something that's of a magnitude that nobody has ever seen before. But I'll tell you what: The federal government has done a hell of a job."
4591,2020-04-05,"So we sent thousands of ventilators to New York, and they didn't know about it at the time. They were complaining. Thousands. We had 2,000, and then 2,000, and then 4,000, and they were going there in large numbers. And then before that, we sent many thousands."
4592,2020-04-05,We want to have so many that we do have more than we need because we can send them to other great countries and other countries that have been our friends. And they'll never be able to do it themselves.
4593,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4594,2020-04-05,"Well, I think we've done a great job for the state of Washington. And I think the governor, who's a failed presidential candidate, as you know — he — he leveled out at zero in the polls. He's constantly chirping and — I guess “complaining” would be a nice way of saying it. We're building hospitals. We've done a great job for the state of Washington."
4595,2020-04-05,"Michigan, all she does is — she has no idea what's going on. And all she does is say, “Oh, it's the federal government's fault.” And we've taken such great care of Michigan. You know the care we've taken of New Jersey. I think if you ask, Governor Murphy of New Jersey, “How are we doing?” I think he'd say, “Great.” I think. He's a Democrat."
4596,2020-04-05,"Governor Cuomo has really said we're really doing a great job. And I saw the news conference where he was thanking the people from FEMA, the people from Army Corps of Engineers this morning. I mean, they built a hospital like in three and a half days and it's a big hospital in the Javits Center, and they're building medical facilities in different parts of New York. And Governor Cuomo has been appreciative."
4597,2020-04-05,"But, you know, a couple of people aren't. We have done a hell of a job; the federal government has really stepped up."
4598,2020-04-05,"All I want them to do — very simple — I want them to be appreciative. I don't want them to say things that aren't true. I want them to be appreciative. We've done a great job. And I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about Mike Pence, the task force; I'm talking about FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers."
4599,2020-04-05,"There's no country in the world that could have done what the Army Corps of Engineers has done and is doing. Now they're going in and building — literally, they're going into hotels and renovating hotels. That should be for governors to do. That should be for states to do. We have the Army Corps of Engineers so teed up and so stocked up, and they're really psyched and they're incredible. And there's no games with these people. They're in there screaming, “Get it done. Get it done.” There's not like sitting around, taking it easy. These are workers. These are incredible people."
4600,2020-04-05,"So I think the Army Corps of Engineers when — when somebody, for political reasons, wants to blame, I view that as blaming these incredible people. Nobody has ever seen it. I don't know if you've been to the Javits Center."
4601,2020-04-05,"Now, I've seen it. I would love to go there, but with all that we're doing — we will be tomorrow at the hospital boat. There's another — we have this incredible hospital boat. It was supposed to be ready in three and a half weeks because it's under maintenance — a big maintenance contract. We were able to get it done quickly. We were able to stock it up to the, you know, top. And it's leaving tomorrow at two o'clock. It's leaving Virginia. It'll be in New York on Monday, weeks ahead of schedule."
4602,2020-04-05,I think things — even the media — I think the media and governors should appreciate it.
4603,2020-04-05,"And I have to say, the media has been pretty good and the governors have been really good, except for a couple. And with them, it's just political: “How's Trump doing?” “Oh well, I don't know, you know. Let's blame...”"
4604,2020-04-05,"Because we have done — we have done a job, the likes of which nobody has seen."
4605,2020-04-05,"I think they should be appreciative because you know what? When they're not appreciative to me, they're not appreciative to the Army Corps. They're not appreciative to FEMA. It's not right. These people are incredible. They're working 24 hours a day. Mike Pence — I mean, Mike Pence, I don't think he sleeps anymore. These — these are people that should be appreciated."
4606,2020-04-05,"He calls all the governors. I tell him — I mean, I'm a different type of person — I say, “Mike, don't call the governor of Washington. You're wasting your time with him. Don't call the woman in Michigan.” All — it doesn't make any difference what happens —"
4607,2020-04-05,"No, no. You know what I say? If they don't treat you right, I don't call. He's a different type of person. He'll call quietly anyway. Okay? But he's done a great job. He should be appreciated for the job he's done."
4608,2020-04-05,"Yes, ma'am."
4609,2020-04-05,No —
4610,2020-04-05,"No, but I have spirit for the country. I mean, we have sailors, we have doctors on that ship. We have everything."
4611,2020-04-05,"I mean, I'm not going to be jumping around in a huddle. But, yeah, I think it's a great sign — the President of the United States — they got a ship out of maintenance, completed all the work in a fraction of the time — you know, it was supposed to be there for three and a half additional weeks, and they got it done and it's in great shape — and they're sending it up."
4612,2020-04-05,"So, the answer is — it's a good question; it's a fair question. I just feel that, as the leader of our country, when they can do work like they've done — and they've been working all day, all night — medical supplies, everything — loading up that ship. I don't think it's the worst thing in the world. It's right down the road, practically. Right? Virginia. And I think it's great if I go to Virginia. I guess I can take helicopter or plane. It's very — it's like a tiny trip. And I think it's a good thing when I go over there and I say “thank you.”"
4613,2020-04-05,"It doesn't mean I'm going to be hugging people and it doesn't mean that I'm going to be shaking people's hands and everything. But I think it sends a signal when the President is able to go there and say thank you. So, you know, we'll be careful."
4614,2020-04-05,Peter.
4615,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I did. We did fill it twice. We filled it twice and we've been distributing that for — for literally a year. We've been —"
4616,2020-04-05,"— filling out — we've been — nice question, Peter. Thank you very much. We've been filling it out and we've been filling that stockpile many, many times. It's been filled many, many times."
4617,2020-04-05,And now what we're doing is something different because I think it's better. We'd fill it so it comes from wherever the point of manufacture or whatever is — we fill it and then we go — now it's full — now we take it and we distribute it around.
4618,2020-04-05,"Now, what we're doing is, we have an emergency — we're saying, “Go direct. Go direct. Go direct.” We fill it only where necessary. But now we're trying to go direct. So they drop it off in New York or they drop it off in Michigan, they drop it off in Virginia, wherever it may be — Florida. Well, Florida is getting a lot — a lot of things. And we're finding it's a much better system. But we've filled and we've stockpiled many, many times. Yeah, we ended up with an empty shelf."
4619,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
4620,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4621,2020-04-05,"So I had a great conversation with the President of China last night, pretty late in the night. It was fascinating to me. You know, they have a whole — it's a different kind of a world. It's a different form of government, to put it mildly."
4622,2020-04-05,"We talked for a long time. We talked for at least an hour, I guess. And one of the things I was asking him is, you know, when did you notice that this was happening? We talked about the whole concept: how it happened, when it happened, what was the most effective use. I mean, was it the fact that, you know, distance — was distance the best thing? We talked about everything."
4623,2020-04-05,"And he's gotten and developed — because they're ahead of us, from the standpoint of time. It happened there actually long before it happened here."
4624,2020-04-05,"By the way, it would have happened here a lot sooner had we not kept those people out — the Chinese people coming over to the country — had we not kept them out. But we talked about it because he's had additional experience of having been much earlier."
4625,2020-04-05,And he's — he's developed some incredible theories and all of that information is coming over here. It's — a lot of it's already come. The data — we call it “data.” And we're going to learn a lot from what the Chinese went through.
4626,2020-04-05,"Our relationship with China is very good. We also talked about the trade agreement. But, I must tell you, this whole invisible enemy has taken over the world. Nobody cares about trade, nobody cares about anything. You want to talk about trade? They immediately get back to this."
4627,2020-04-05,"So we really did — we talked about trade. You know, they're starting to buy very heavily from the farmers under the agreement — under the trade deal that we just signed. But honestly, he, me, all of us — everybody is talking — you turn on television, you read the papers, it's all about this."
4628,2020-04-05,"And you know what? It probably should be mostly about this. It's hard to talk about, “Hey, how you doing with buying from the farmers?” They have started very, very large buying, as you probably have read, but what we really focused on was this."
4629,2020-04-05,"I also said, “How have you done with cures and how have you done with respect to vaccines?” We discussed that. And, you know, they're doing like we're doing. They're working on it very hard. They think they have some interesting — interesting things have — have been determined and we'll see what happens. But we talked a lot about vaccine. We talked a lot about possible cures. What — how good would that be? I mean that's a game changer. So we'll see."
4630,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, we have various things happening right now, having to do with cures and vaccines. And I think we're doing — I think we're doing very well. Especially in the vaccine thing, I think we're very close. But as Tony will tell you, that's a long testing process. So we'll see what happens."
4631,2020-04-05,"He never asked me to suspended tariffs. No, we're taking in billions of dollars. He never did ask me that."
4632,2020-04-05,John.
4633,2020-04-05,"So, John, I'll be sitting down with this brilliant woman and this brilliant man and lots of brilliant people that work with them, I think — right, Deborah and Tony? And we'll be sitting down on Monday, or maybe Tuesday, depending on which is the best for everybody, and we'll be making that determination. Okay? We'll be making it."
4634,2020-04-05,"And, by the way, obviously we're not doing it for New York. You see New York is just coming into this really heated situation. We're building a lot of things in New York right now that nobody thought we'd ever be building. A lot of things are happening in New York."
4635,2020-04-05,"So, obviously — but we are talking about possibly other parts of the country, which really are affected to any major degree. Or maybe we won't do that because maybe, at the advice of a lot of very talented people that do this for a living, they won't want to do that. They won't want to expose anything. They want to do it all at one time. These are the kind of things we'll be talking about."
4636,2020-04-05,"Well, it depends. We do want to flatten the curve. We want to see that curve start heading down in the other direction, at a minimum. And we really have to talk about areas of the country that have not been affected or certainly have had a very small effect. And we'll see."
4637,2020-04-05,"I certainly want to get it open as soon as possible. I don't want it to be long, but we also want it to open safe. Otherwise, what did we do?"
4638,2020-04-05,I hope not. I hope it's going to be sooner. I hope it disappears faster than that. I really think that the people of our country have done a great job.
4639,2020-04-05,"I looked — last night, I was watching, and I'm looking down Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue. John, there were no people in the street. I mean, normally, you wouldn't be able to see the sidewalk. There would be cars all over it. It would be like rush-hour stuff. I'm looking at it and I'm saying “I can't believe it. There are no cars. There are no people.” There wasn't one person on Fifth Avenue walking down the street. I've never seen that before. You know, I guess, maybe at one o'clock in the morning, four o'clock in the morning, maybe. But I've never seen that before."
4640,2020-04-05,"The people have been incredible. They've really been — when you talk about distancing — social distancing — I mean, you know, it's — we don't have a law. We're not going to put them in jail. And yet, they're really — I think there's two things. Number one, they are afraid. And number two, they really are wanting to win this thing."
4641,2020-04-05,"Yes. Yes, please."
4642,2020-04-05,Sure.
4643,2020-04-05,"So, yeah, sure. It's a good question. We have brilliant people. We have a tremendous amount of money. And we have brilliant people that I'm taking from Wall Street with Secretary Mnuchin, who's done an incredible job. A brilliant guy."
4644,2020-04-05,"I'm taking from Wall Street people that I've known, that you all know. The top people in the world. They don't want money, they don't want — I mean, will they get something? Yes, maybe they'll get — who knows? Peanuts, what they want — compared to what they would normally get."
4645,2020-04-05,"I'm taking the smartest, the most brilliant people in the world in finance, and they're going to be dealing. I'm not going to hire — I'm not going to hire somebody that's never done it, that's a political person or anything else. We're getting the most brilliant financial minds in the world. I know all of them, and you know all of them. I mean, you read about all of them. I guess, some you don't read about, and they're probably the smartest of them all."
4646,2020-04-05,"But the fact is we're taking these brilliant people, and they'll be dealing with United. And they want to help. Look, the airline business — I'll tell you right now: The airline business has always been a tough business. It's always been a very tough business. Tough to make money with, with — it's got every — every barrier you could have, that business has. But for our country, it's very important. We have to take care of our country. We need the airlines to stay. It's also big for jobs. So we will be able to handle United, and we'll be able to handle Delta, and we'll be able to handle all of it. We have plenty of money."
4647,2020-04-05,"Now, will we end up owning large chunks, depending on what these great geniuses decide, along with the executives of the different companies? You know, it's possible. And they'll make a better deal on the loan, but the taxpayer will then end up owning a big chunk of companies."
4648,2020-04-05,"As an example, Boeing — Boeing, until a year ago, was the greatest company, I think, in the world by far. There wasn't — to me, there wasn't anything close. I believe it was 1 percent of GDP. Okay? Think of it. One company, 1 percent of GDP. It was flawless. Then it had the problems, and then it had on top of it this whole thing with the virus. So Boeing will probably need a hand, and we're going to bring Boeing back to health."
4649,2020-04-05,"But we have the smartest people in the world. We have the smartest. I don't even know if you know that. I think this could be the first time you've heard it. People like Larry Fink we're talking to, and — that's BlackRock. And we have, you know, the smartest people. And they all want to do it. They all — I mean, this to them — they love this country; they all want to do it. So we're speaking to people like that, and they'll be able to work it out."
4650,2020-04-05,"No, I think they're the same thing. I mean, you know, bringing people back to health and protecting people's jobs. To me — and I'm okay with this stuff — that's the same thing. I'm in a much different position as President than if I were an investor or something."
4651,2020-04-05,"But I want to bring them back to health because I want to preserve their jobs, but I also want to preserve airlines, because that's preserving lots of other jobs. That's preserving the travel and leisure industry, which is perhaps the largest industry in our country, if you add it all up. You add up all the hotels and all of the traveling and all the planes and everything else — probably, by far, the largest industry in our country."
4652,2020-04-05,"So, saving the airlines is very important. And the airlines were all doing well. You know, the airlines were doing record business a month before this — today, let's say. Even 22 days to be exact — right? — when we first started seeing some real signs of problems. They were at record levels. Last year, they had a record year — the biggest in the history of the airlines. Everybody was doing well."
4653,2020-04-05,"I mean, I was presiding over the most successful economy in the history of the world. And now we're going to have to rebuild it. And I think we're going to have an absolute incredible fourth quarter. You know, and maybe it's slightly after that, to be honest. But it's going to be in that time period."
4654,2020-04-05,"As soon as we get rid of this, I think we're going to have an explosion upward. It's going to be incredible."
4655,2020-04-05,Please.
4656,2020-04-05,That's true.
4657,2020-04-05,"I do, because he's a very talented guy. He's a very good governor. Everyone loves him. He's doing a fantastic job for Florida."
4658,2020-04-05,"He was not happy with the people coming down from New York. You know, they're flying down from New York, and he had a state — and has a state — with, you know, obviously a lot less problems. Florida has been doing really well in the sense of testing. The testing has shown much better results. I mean, they'll talk to you about that later."
4659,2020-04-05,"But, no, he was very unhappy with the people coming down from New York, and I understand that. No, Ron is a very tough guy. He's a great governor. And I have tremendous confidence in him. And, you know, he had the beach situation. He resolved that. He will get it all resolved."
4660,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4661,2020-04-05,You have to go louder. You have to speak louder.
4662,2020-04-05,"Well, we have some very, very strong restrictions. But you're right, I don't like it. So we're seeing how it works. The data is coming in on Monday and Tuesday, and we're going to see how it looks. But, you know, can we go to a tougher level? We can, but that causes other problems. We're going to see, and we'll be reporting back very shortly after my meetings with Tony, Deborah, and others that we're going to be meeting — and our Vice President. And we're going to be reporting back to the media, okay?"
4663,2020-04-05,Please. Corner?
4664,2020-04-05,Yes.
4665,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4666,2020-04-05,"I would say that you are a citizen of the greatest country anywhere in the world. And we were attacked like nothing that's happened possibly since 1917 — many, many years ago. We were attacked."
4667,2020-04-05,"And we're winning the battle and we're going to win the war, and it's not going to take, hopefully, that much longer. But we have to win the war."
4668,2020-04-05,"And I would say that they have a duty to sit back, watch, behave, wash their hands, stay in the apartment with mom and dad — they look like they're lucky to have you as a father — and just learn from it."
4669,2020-04-05,"But, you know, they're — the young people have been tremendous. They — some of them are very happy not to go to school. You understand that. Perhaps yours, perhaps, not. But they've been — we've had no — we have literally had no problem. But again, they should just sit back and be very proud of our country, because we're doing it for them. You know, ultimately we're doing it for them, more than anything else, if you think about it."
4670,2020-04-05,"The other thing that's nice and the one thing that has come out, and I learned this — again, it was reaffirmed by President Xi last night in my conversation: The young people are really — this is an incredible phenomena, but they are attacked — successfully attacked — to a much lesser extent by this pandemic, by this disease, this — whatever they want to call it. You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus. You know, you can call it many different names. I'm not sure anybody even knows what it is. But the children do very well. It's almost the younger they are, the better they do. I guess the immune system is, sadly, for some of us — their immune system is stronger. But actually, I'm very happy about that."
4671,2020-04-05,"But they have been attacked — for instance, the Spanish Flu, and if you look at the H1N1, the swine — if you take a look at the swine flu, which was, as you know, not so long ago, that attacked very strongly young children, kids, middle-aged people, everyone. Age is a — age is a factor here. So your children should be in good shape. But just tell them to be very proud of the country. Okay?"
4672,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to make that determination. And you're going to have something to do with that. And, look, we're going to be guided also. You have some real strong feelings."
4673,2020-04-05,"The media — I'll tell you what: The media, generally — I mean, I — I'm impressed. A lot of the media has been fair. I'm not used to fair treatment in the media. And, I don't know, I don't know how to handle it. But the media has really been — overall, I think the media has been pretty fair. Some not. I mean, I could tell you who, but what's the point? But the media has really been fair. I mean, they view this as we're all in a problem together and we're going to win. We're going to win."
4674,2020-04-05,Please.
4675,2020-04-05,It is. Yeah.
4676,2020-04-05,"Well, that's not happening. I mean, I think they wrote us out, and that's all right. But that's not happening."
4677,2020-04-05,"As far as the mayor of New York, I'll be honest — I didn't know him well. He and I are obviously opposite persuasions. And we would go at it, but we didn't — I don't know if we ever spoke other than to maybe say hello a couple of times. I did down at the Memorial — World Trade Center Memorial once a long time ago."
4678,2020-04-05,"So I have spoken to him a lot — Mayor de Blasio — and we've really had incredibly productive discussions. I've gotten him a lot of people. We've gotten him a medical center. He's asked for, at Elmhurst — I know Elmhurst hospital very well. I mean, that was an area of Queens that I grew up in. And, boy, you talk about an epicenter; that's really the epicenter of the epicenter. That's really something."
4679,2020-04-05,"We talked about it because that was, you know, very close to where I grew up. And — and, you know, knowing it — being so familiar with it, it's incredible to see where they have the trucks. I don't have to go into great detail. The refrigerated trucks coming up and — I've never seen anything like it."
4680,2020-04-05,"I've spoken with Mayor de Blasio a lot in the last week. We've helped him, I think, a lot. And I've really gotten to like him. I get along with him very well. Now, he wants us to do certain things, and we've produced. I mean, today, I spoke to him with the Secretary of Defense, Esper. And we had a great conversation, and we're helping him get some of the things he needs. I don't have to go into great detail, but he's very happy about what we're able to do for him today."
4681,2020-04-05,"And he's like us: He's working very hard. But I can't say anything bad about Mayor de Blasio. I mean, my relationship with him over the last couple of weeks has been excellent. And we've done a good job for him, too."
4682,2020-04-05,Please.
4683,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4684,2020-04-05,So we're doing that. Great question. We're increasing capacities.
4685,2020-04-05,"Right. We're actually adding on, through the Army Corps of Engineers. This is a big job, and we're doing it in many states — not just New York and California. By the way, Gavin Newsom has been terrific, I have to tell you — the governor of California. We're getting along really well. We're working hard for him. As you know, the hospital ship — the other hospital ship. And they are incredible. That just arrived in Los Angeles, fully stocked."
4686,2020-04-05,"But Gavin Newsom has been really good, and so many of the governors have been good. And these are governors that I've been fighting with about different things for a long time — the forest fires, in his case, and the border, and all sorts of things. And here we are, getting along very well. So — and I appreciate his nice words. I really do. I really appreciate it. It's — and the people with me appreciate it."
4687,2020-04-05,Do you have another question?
4688,2020-04-05,Yeah. So —
4689,2020-04-05,Good — good question.
4690,2020-04-05,"Yeah, well — I mean, look, we just started this. You know, we were just notified. And some of the governors have asked us to build hospitals through extensions, through portable hospitals, through things. And, you know, normally, this — in all fairness, this is done normally through local government. We don't go into cities and expand a hospital that's existing. But we're doing it now because we really are equipped to do it. We have incredible people."
4691,2020-04-05,"And we're expanding hospitals. We're building many portable hospitals, not only Javits Center. We have four — plus, you have four medical centers. But we're doing it in New Jersey — Governor Murphy. We're doing it in other states. We're doing it in California. We're doing some in the State of Washington, despite the fact that I — I'm not appreciative of the way the governor speaks. We're doing it in a lot of different locations. And we're doing a lot of expansions."
4692,2020-04-05,"We're also taking over buildings, and the city will go in or the state usually will go in, take over a building, and we go in and equip it and make it so that it's now hospital functioning. They call it “hospital functioning.” We're doing a lot of that."
4693,2020-04-05,"Again, this is normally done by governors and then give it to the city to do. You know, you bring it into the point. But we're doing a lot of that, and they're doing a great job — mostly done by the Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA."
4694,2020-04-05,"That, I don't know. That, I don't know."
4695,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Well, they say I had classified briefings a long time ago, which wasn't true. But we've had briefings, and, as I know it, the governors have also had many briefings by the federal government."
4696,2020-04-05,"Oh, I think we knew — I think we knew for a while. But if you take a look, I was the first one to say to China — and I have great respect for China, I will tell you that. But I was the first one, when they had the problem, to say, “You can't come in.” And if you go back, that's a long time ago."
4697,2020-04-05,"Jon, please."
4698,2020-04-05,"Here's what we're going to have. Are you ready? We're going to have more than — we're manufacturing a lot of them now. We're accumulating a lot. We're taking a lot, through the act. We're taking a lot. We're actually taking them. And we're going to have, in a very short period of time — and Peter is doing it, along with some very talented people. Some really talented people. It's very impressive actually. But we're actually taking a lot. We're going to have plenty."
4699,2020-04-05,And if for some reason —
4700,2020-04-05,"Jon, if for some reason you're going to need even more, we're going to be prepared. As an example, we now — we've given out thousands and thousands, which I think you'll know. We accumulated thousands; we give them out. But we — right now, I think in the stockpile we have over 10,000."
4701,2020-04-05,"The reason we don't want to distribute that is for exactly what you're saying. If there's a mad rush in New York or maybe in Louisiana or maybe someplace else, we don't want to have given out all of those units — the ventilators — and then in those sections, we give them to Iowa, but they didn't have a problem in Iowa, or we give them to Idaho, we give them to lots of different places. And now we have to try and get them back, which is never easy to do."
4702,2020-04-05,"No, no, Jon, what I'm saying is this: We are prepared for things that nobody has any idea that we'd be prepared. And you know what? When I took this over, it was an empty box. We didn't have testing. We didn't have anything. We had a broken system there. We had a broken system with stockpiling. We had a lot of broken systems."
4703,2020-04-05,"And I'm not just blaming President Obama. You go long before that. But in all fairness to all of the former Presidents, none of them ever thought a thing like this could happen."
4704,2020-04-05,"But we have, right now, 10,000 ventilators in stockpile. We are ready to go with those ventilators. What we don't want is where we distribute the ventilators, like we did in New York and they didn't need them, or they didn't know, or they didn't use them. If we need them in New York, we're going to have plenty."
4705,2020-04-05,"Now, we're getting a lot of ventilators in the next short period of time. A lot of ventilators are coming in the next short period of time. We're manufacturing. We went to all of the companies; I read their names. We went to all of those companies. They are going to go, I would say, round the clock, Peter. Is that right? They're going around the clock."
4706,2020-04-05,"Let's put it this way. Let's put it this way: We've distributed thousands and thousands already. Normally, these would be bought by states, just so you understand. Normally, these would be bought by governors. They were — I don't want to say unprepared, but nobody was prepared for this. What we've done, nobody can even imagine. And, by the way, I've had governors tell me, including Democrat governors — they said, “We can't believe you've been able to do this.”"
4707,2020-04-05,"And you go to other countries — and we're not only competing against states, because we don't want to compete against states. We've had a couple of cases where states were buying and we were buying, and I said specifically, because I heard about it, “Pull back. Let the state buy it.” Immediately, the price goes way down, and they end up buying it."
4708,2020-04-05,"But we're also competing against many countries, because many countries need the ventilators. That's why I want to build more if possible."
4709,2020-04-05,"Jon, maybe we'll take one more question."
4710,2020-04-05,Jon.
4711,2020-04-05,So here's what I'll tell you: I think we're in really good shape. This is a pandemic the likes of which nobody has seen before.
4712,2020-04-05,"I think we're in great shape. I think that, number one, we've distributed — a ventilator is a big deal. We've distributed vast numbers of ventilators, and we're prepared to do vast numbers. I think we're in great shape. I hope that's the case. I hope that we're going to have leftovers so we can help other people, other countries."
4713,2020-04-05,"Look — look, don't be a cutie pie. Okay?"
4714,2020-04-05,"You know, everyone who needs one. Nobody has ever done what we've done. Nobody has done anything like we've been able to do. And everything I took over was a mess. It was a broken country in so many ways. In so many ways other than this."
4715,2020-04-05,"We had a bad testing system. We had a bad stockpile system. We had nothing in the stockpile system. So I wouldn't tell me what you're telling — you know, like being a wise guy."
4716,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
4717,2020-04-05,Yeah. Well —
4718,2020-04-05,"Well, there may be something where we're going to have to help states, because the states have been hurt very badly. And the beautiful thing about our country is: $6.2 trillion, because it is 2.2 plus 4. It's $6.2 trillion. And we can handle that easily because of who we are, what we are. It's our — it's our money. It's our — we are the ones. It's our currency. We can handle it, and we can handle — I watched Jerome Powell the other day, and he did a good job. He said, “We'll do whatever we have to do.” John, we have to do whatever we have to do."
4719,2020-04-05,"The priority is life and safety, and then the economy. Life and safety."
4720,2020-04-05,"Well, we'll see."
4721,2020-04-05,"No, no, no."
4722,2020-04-05,We'll see. A lot of things can —
4723,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4724,2020-04-05,"I tell them: If it's your life and it's your safety and if we need more time, they're not going to have a problem waiting it out. It's life, it's safety, and it's our country. But we have to take care of people. At the same time, we want to get them out. They want to get out. Our country was built on that. But we have to make sure it's safe, and everyone knows that."
4725,2020-04-05,"Okay, one more question. Please."
4726,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
4727,2020-04-05,"So, hydroxychloroquine, which is supposed to be the better of the two, seems to have some good backing. We're going to see."
4728,2020-04-05,"Look, Governor Cuomo — we've given him 10,000 units; that's a lot — and they're testing it. It's a malaria drug. It's also a drug for arthritis. But — and it's phenomenal for those two things, as you probably know, especially for malaria. But we're going to find out soon. I hope it works. It's — there are signs that it could be doing well. They are testing 10,000 units. That's a lot."
4729,2020-04-05,"And I tell you what: I want to thank the FDA because they approved it immediately, based on the fact that it was already out for a different purpose. They approved it immediately."
4730,2020-04-05,"So, look, hydroxychloroquine is — is a very powerful drug for certain things, and it's a very successful drug. There's reason to believe that it could be successful here. Now, the reason I disagree with you — and I think Tony would disagree with me — but the reason I disagree with you is that we have a pandemic. We have people dying now. If we're going to go into labs and test all of this for a long time, we can test it on people right now who are in serious trouble, who are dying. If it works, we've done a great thing. If it doesn't work, you know, we tried."
4731,2020-04-05,"But this is not something that's going to kill people. So, we can go in and we can test, or we can take our time. When I was with the FDA, you know, they indicated that, “Well, we'll start working on it right away, and it could take a year.” I said, “What do you mean a year? We have to have it tonight.” If we don't have it tonight — I want to test it immediately because it's on the market in a different form. So, we know that. So, from a safety standpoint, at least, we know that."
4732,2020-04-05,"But you're talking about giving it to people who, in many cases, are dying. So we want to do with the way — this is sort of like Right to Try. We got Right to Try approved. For —"
4733,2020-04-05,"John, for 44 years or more, they couldn't get it approved. We have the best labs, the best doctors. They couldn't get it. I got it approved. Now, if somebody is terminally ill, and if we think we have something that's going to work, we can actually use it; they can use it."
4734,2020-04-05,"And I'll tell you what: You ought to do — when this is over, you got to do a story on that because we have had some tremendous results."
4735,2020-04-05,"It's not even talked to me about. It's just more fake news, John."
4736,2020-04-05,"Look, not even talked to me. They're talking about — the only one I've heard that from — like, as an example, China pays 25 percent interest on $250 billion worth of product that they send in. That's a lot. Everybody keeps saying, “Oh, are you going to suspend the tariffs?” Well, the answer is no. But President Xi never even brought it up last night. It wasn't even discussed. It's fake news. Tell the Wall Street Journal. You know, the Wall Street Journal does a lot of fake news too. It's pretty amazing."
4737,2020-04-05,"So I want to leave — leave you by just saying I want to thank you for being here. I want to thank the American public and all of the people that have helped so much. And we're going to give the podium to Vice President Pence, who has been incredible. And if he's tired and if he's not answering questions like he should, we have a great reason because he hasn't slept in about four weeks."
4738,2020-04-05,"But I want to thank him because he has dedicated — I mean, he is a dedicated person — long before this. But the job he's done has been fantastic. So I want to thank Mike, all the people on the task force, and FEMA, and Army Corps — everybody. You've been fantastic. Thank you all very much."
4739,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Thank you. So, I'm glad to see that you're practicing social distancing. That looks very nice. It's very good."
4740,2020-04-05,"I want to thank everybody for being here today. This morning I spoke with the leaders of the G7 — G7 nations — and they really had a good meeting. I think it was a very, very productive meeting. I also spoke with our nation's governors."
4741,2020-04-05,"This afternoon, we're announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days as we combat the virus. Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus. We did this today, and this was done by a lot of very talented people, some of whom are standing with me. And that's available. And Dr. Birx will be speaking about that in just a few minutes."
4742,2020-04-05,"It's important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience milder symptoms, they can easily spread this virus, and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm's way. We especially worry about our senior citizens."
4743,2020-04-05,The White House Task Force meets every day and continually updates guidelines based on the fast-evolving situation that this has become all over the world. It's all over the world. It's incredible what's happened in such a short period of time.
4744,2020-04-05,"On the guidelines of the task force, the new modeling conducted by Dr. Birx, and our consultation with governors, we've made the decision to further toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now. We'd much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it, and that's what we are. Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible. Avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people. Avoid discretionary travel. And avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts."
4745,2020-04-05,"If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus. And we're going to have a big celebration all together."
4746,2020-04-05,"With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly. A lot of progress has been made. I'm also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history. Not even close. We're also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments. And we've had some promising results — early results, but promising — to reduce the severity and the duration of the synd- — of the symptoms."
4747,2020-04-05,"And I have to say that our government is prepared to do whatever it takes. Whatever it takes, we're doing. We're doing it in every way."
4748,2020-04-05,"And with that, I'd like to just introduce Dr. Birx, who's going to discuss some of the things that we strongly recommend."
4749,2020-04-05,Thank you.
4750,2020-04-05,"Okay, go ahead."
4751,2020-04-05,"My favorite question; I ask it all the time. How many times, Anthony, I think I ask him that question. Every day. And I speak to Deborah; I speak to a lot of them. I get the opinion."
4752,2020-04-05,"So it seems to me that if we do a really good job, we'll not only hold the death down to a level that is much lower than the other way had we not done a good job. But people are talking about July, August, something like that. So it could be right in that period of time where it, I say, wash — it washes through. Other people don't like that term. But where it washes through."
4753,2020-04-05,"We'll see what happens. But they think August. Could be July. Could be longer than that. But I've asked that question many, many times."
4754,2020-04-05,Yes.
4755,2020-04-05,"Yeah. No, I think they are very scared. They see that we're doing a very professional job. We've been working with the governors and the — frankly, the mayors, local government at every level. We have FEMA totally involved. FEMA has been — you know, usually we see FEMA for the hurricanes and the tornados. Now we have FEMA involved in this. They've been doing a fantastic job locally working with people that they know because they work — like, as an example, in California, in the State of Washington, they work with them a lot on other things, and they're very familiar. So they're working on it."
4756,2020-04-05,"What you can do and all you can do is — professional, totally competent. We have the best people in the world. We have, really, the greatest experts in the world. And someday soon, hopefully, it'll end and we'll be back to where it was."
4757,2020-04-05,"But this came up — it came up so suddenly. Look, he was surprised; we were all surprised. We heard about it. We heard about reports from China that something was happening and all of a sudden — we did make a good decision; we closed our borders to China very quickly, very rapidly. That was a — that was a — otherwise, we'd be in a very — as Tony has said numerous times, we'd be in a very bad position, much worse than we would be right now. You look at what's happening in other countries: Italy is having a very hard time."
4758,2020-04-05,"But I think that — I think that what we do — and I've spoken actually with my son. He says, “How bad is this?” It's bad. It's bad. But we're going to — we're going to be, hopefully, a best case, not a worst case. And that's what we're working for."
4759,2020-04-05,Yes.
4760,2020-04-05,"Well, we have that very much. Yeah, we have that very much. And we are — we've been pretty aggressive. We were early with Europe, but we were very, very early with China and other places. And, fortunately, we were."
4761,2020-04-05,"And as far as containment here, we are. We're coming out with strong suggestions. And, you know, it's becoming a little bit automatic. If you look at people, they're not doing certain things. For instance, there's obviously not — I wouldn't say the restaurant business is booming, and bars and grills and all. People are self-containing for — to a large extent."
4762,2020-04-05,We look forward to the day where we can get back to normal.
4763,2020-04-05,Go ahead. What's your second question?
4764,2020-04-05,"At this point not nationwide, but — well, there are some — you know, some places in our nation that are not very affected at all. But we may — we may look at certain areas, certain — certain hotspots, as they call them. We'll be looking at that. But at this moment, no, we're not."
4765,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4766,2020-04-05,"Well, I had my test — it was late Friday night. And the reason I did it was because the — I had no symptoms whatsoever, so the doctor said, “You have no symptoms, so we don't see any reason.”"
4767,2020-04-05,"But when I did the press conference on Friday, everybody was going crazy. “Did you do the test? Did you do the test?” So, very late on Friday night, I did the test. And he may have put out — or the doctor may have put out something at a — I don't know what time the letter went out, maybe it was put out by somebody else, but the results came back, I believe, the following day. And we tested negative."
4768,2020-04-05,"Well, I told them that — and I went totally by what they said — the doctors, more than one. They said, “You don't have any of the symptoms.” They checked what you're supposed to check and that I didn't have symptoms. But I did it — I did a test late on Friday night. And it came back probably 24 hours later or something. They sent it to the labs; it came back later."
4769,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
4770,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4771,2020-04-05,"If they can get them faster by getting them on their own — in other words, go through a supply chain that they may have. Because the governors — you know, during normal times, the governors buy a lot of things not necessarily through federal government."
4772,2020-04-05,"If they're able to get ventilators, respirators, if they're able to get certain things without having to go through the longer process of federal government — we have stockpiles now and we're ordering tremendous numbers of ventilators, respirators, masks. And they're ordered, and they're coming, and we have quite a few at this point. I think, Mike, we have a lot."
4773,2020-04-05,"But if they can — if they can get them directly — it's always going to be faster if they can get them directly, if they need them. And I've given them authorization to order directly"
4774,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
4775,2020-04-05,That's right.
4776,2020-04-05,"Well, first of all, we hope we don't get there. And that's what we're doing, and that's why we're taking a very strict look at this. But we also are looking at areas — and not only looking; we're expanding certain areas. We're taking over buildings that aren't used. We're doing a lot in that regard. We hope we don't have to get there, but we are doing a lot in that regard."
4777,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4778,2020-04-05,"Well, we're looking at that. And we may be expanding that. We are looking at that."
4779,2020-04-05,We want fairness.
4780,2020-04-05,We want it for everybody.
4781,2020-04-05,"No, we're looking at that through the Senate, because as you know, the Senate is now digesting that bill."
4782,2020-04-05,So we may very well be adding something on that. Okay? Good question.
4783,2020-04-05,"I can get back to you with that number. We've ordered a lot. We have quite a few, but it may not be enough. And if it's not enough, we will have it by the time we need it. Hopefully, we won't need them."
4784,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we'll be able to give you —"
4785,2020-04-05,"Well, we'll give you. We can give you a number. If it's important, we'll give you a number. Go ahead."
4786,2020-04-05,"Well, when I'm talking about control, I'm saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we're dealing with. We're doing a very good job. There's been a — there's been a tremendous amount of the way they're working together. They're working hand-in-hand. I think they're doing, really, a great job. And from that standpoint, that's what I was referring to."
4787,2020-04-05,"Yeah, Steve, go ahead."
4788,2020-04-05,"I'm not referring to “it,” meaning the –"
4789,2020-04-05,"Yeah, if you're talking about the virus —"
4790,2020-04-05,"No, that's not under control for any place in the world. I think I read —"
4791,2020-04-05,I think I read —
4792,2020-04-05,"No, I didn't. I was talking about what we're doing is under control. But I'm not talking about the virus."
4793,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
4794,2020-04-05,"Well, it may be. We're not thinking in terms of recession, we're thinking in terms of the virus. Once we stop — I think there's a tremendous pent-up demand, both in terms of the stock market and in terms of the economy. And once this goes away, once it goes through and we're done with it, I think you're going to see a tremendous — a tremendous surge."
4795,2020-04-05,"We're not really. We hope we don't have to, Steve. We think that hopefully we won't have to do that. But it's certainly something that we talk about every day. We haven't made that decision."
4796,2020-04-05,"Yeah, well, I think the federal government is doing everything that we can possibly do. We made some very good early decisions by keeping people out, by keeping bor- — countries out — certain countries where the infection was very immense. I noticed a lot of people are talking about South Korea because they've done a good job on one side, but on the other side, tremendous problems at the beginning. They had tremendous problems and great numbers of death."
4797,2020-04-05,"I think that we've done a fantastic job from just about every standpoint. With that being said, you look — no matter where you look, this is something — it's an invisible enemy. And — but we are speaking all the time, not only with the people, but also the professional people — the nurses, the doctors. They have been doing a fantastic job."
4798,2020-04-05,"We are also working very much on getting them the kind of equipment that they need. And for the most part, they're either — they either have it or they will be getting it."
4799,2020-04-05,"But remember this: we want the governors, we want the mayors, we want them locally — from a local standpoint, because it can go quicker — we want them to work. And we had a great talk with the governors today. I think it was a really great talk. There's a tremendous coordination. There's a tremendous spirit that we have together with the governors. And that's pretty much, for the most part, bipartisan."
4800,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4801,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't — I don't, number one, determine recession. I just say this: We have an invisible enemy. We have a problem that a month ago nobody ever thought about. Nobody in the — you know, I've read about it. I read about — many years ago, 1917, 1918. I've seen all of the different — the different problems similar to this that we've had."
4802,2020-04-05,"This is a bad one. This is a very bad one. This is bad in the sense that it's so contagious. It's just so contagious. Sort of, record-setting-type contagion. And the good part is the young people are — they do very well. And healthy people do very well. Very, very bad for older people, especially older people with problems."
4803,2020-04-05,"My focus is really on getting rid of this problem — this virus problem. Once we do that, everything else is going to fall into place."
4804,2020-04-05,"Yes, please."
4805,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4806,2020-04-05,I've been reading — I've been watching.
4807,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know. I mean, that I can't tell you, if they are or not. I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair. I think people are pulling together on this. I really think the media has been very fair."
4808,2020-04-05,"I think it could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games. But it doesn't matter. We haven't really determined to do that at all. And hopefully, we won't have to. That's a very big step. It's a step we can take, but we have not decided to do it."
4809,2020-04-05,"Jennifer, go."
4810,2020-04-05,Yes.
4811,2020-04-05,"Well, I've heard that's true. I don't know that for a fact. But I know that some of my people have, as I understand it, been dealing with them or with him. And that's nice. We've had tremendous support from a lot of people that can help, and I believe he was one of them."
4812,2020-04-05,"As far as the airlines are concerned, the airlines — we're going to back the airlines 100 percent. It's not their fault. It's nobody's fault, unless you go to the original source. But it's nobody's fault. And we're going to be in a position to help the airlines very much. We've told the airlines we're going to help them."
4813,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to be helping. We're going to be backstopping the airlines. We're going to be helping them very much, John. It's very important."
4814,2020-04-05,"We're going to be looking at it very strongly. We have to back the airlines. It's not their fault. In fact, they were having a record season — everybody was. They were having record seasons, and then this came out. And it came out from nowhere. So, not their fault, but we're going to be backing the airline. Yeah."
4815,2020-04-05,"The best thing I can do for the stock market is we have to get through this crisis. That's what I can do. That's the best thing we can do. That's what I think about. Once — once this virus is gone, I think you're going to have a stock market like nobody has ever seen before."
4816,2020-04-05,Yeah. That would be the outside number. Yeah.
4817,2020-04-05,"Hold on one second. Please, go ahead."
4818,2020-04-05,"I think they may make it even better. Look, they're working together very well with the House. They're working very much in unison, like the question before. They're working to only enhance it and make it better, and make it fair for everybody. And that's what we're looking to do. So, we may go back and forth with the House a little bit, but both will be in a very positive fashion."
4819,2020-04-05,Please.
4820,2020-04-05,"Well, let me just have the professionals answer that. Would you like to do that? Please."
4821,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
4822,2020-04-05,"Go ahead. Yes, Mike. Please."
4823,2020-04-05,"I think the Admiral can answer that. And you might want to talk about the roving, also."
4824,2020-04-05,So I think just to put it a different way: A lot of — a lot of testing has been going on. And I don't believe anybody has been able to do what we're doing and what we will be doing.
4825,2020-04-05,"So this has never been done before. That's never been done, and certainly not on a level like that. And I will say that — I think I can speak for the professionals, that if you don't have the symptoms, if your doctor doesn't think you need it, don't get the test. Don't get the test. I think it's very important. Not everybody should run out and get the test. But we're able to handle tremendous numbers of people."
4826,2020-04-05,John?
4827,2020-04-05,"We're looking into it. We've heard that. We've heard it from, really, two places. There are two places that have — specifically, New York being one. And we are looking into it very strongly."
4828,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Steve go ahead, please."
4829,2020-04-05,"I've always washed my hands a lot. I wash my hands a lot, probably — maybe, if anything, more. Certainly not less."
4830,2020-04-05,"Not — not something I want to do every day, I can tell you that. It's — you know, it's a little bit of a — it's a little bit of — of good doctors in the White House. But it's a test. It's a test. It's a medical test. Nothing pleasant about it."
4831,2020-04-05,"Well, I think he can do more."
4832,2020-04-05,"But I think — I think he can do more. And, you know, it's an area of the country that's very hot right now. I think New Rochelle — and a place I know very well; I grew up right near New Rochelle — I think it's a very —"
4833,2020-04-05,"No, I think it's an area that has to be tamped down even more because it's a hotbed. There's no question about it. So I think they can look at doing it."
4834,2020-04-05,"But we're getting along very well. We've had a very — in fact, I noticed he made some statements just now that the relationship with the federal government has been good. The federal government has done everything they've wanted us to do. But we can — I think — I think it's very important that all of the governors get along very well with us and that we get along with the governors, and I think that's happening."
4835,2020-04-05,"Well, we haven't thought of it, but, you know, I will say this: That it's — we're very careful. We're very careful with, you know, being together. Even the people behind me are very — they've been very strongly tested. I've been very strongly tested. And we have to be very careful, but everybody should be. Vigilant. We have to be vigilant."
4836,2020-04-05,"I'd rate it a 10. I think we've done a great job. And it started with the fact that we kept a very highly infected country — despite all of the — even the professionals saying, “No, it's too early to do that.” We were very, very, early with respect to China. And we would have a whole different situation in this country if we didn't do that."
4837,2020-04-05,"I would rate it a very, very — I would rate ourselves and the professionals — I think the professionals have done a fantastic job."
4838,2020-04-05,"As far as the testing — you heard the Admiral — I think the testing that we've done, we really took over an obsolete system or, put it maybe in a different way, a system that wasn't meant to do anything like this — we took it over. And we're doing something that's never been done in this country. And I think that we are doing very well."
4839,2020-04-05,"We took the system, we worked with the system we had, and we broke down the system, purposely. We broke it down in order to do what we're doing now. And within a short period of time — and even now — we're testing tremendous numbers of people. And ultimately, you're saying it will be what? It will be up to — how many people will be — we'll be able to test?"
4840,2020-04-05,"Yeah, normally. But I think when you hear the — you know, this has never been done before in this country. If you look back — you know, take a look at some of the things that took place in ‘09 or '11, or whatever it may have been. They never did — nobody has ever done anything like what we're doing."
4841,2020-04-05,"Now, I will also say — Admiral, I think we can say that we're also getting this ready for the future so that when we have a future problem — if and when, and hopefully we don't have anything like this — but if there is, we're going to be very — we're going to be starting off from a much higher plateau. Because we were at a very, very low base."
4842,2020-04-05,"We had a system that was not meant for this. It was a smaller system. It was meant for a much different purpose. And for that purpose, it was fine, but not for this purpose. So we broke down the system, and now we have something that's going to be — and is — very special, and is ready for future problems. And I think we can say that very strongly."
4843,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Go ahead, please."
4844,2020-04-05,"Well, I'd leave that up to the states. It's a big thing postponing an election. I think, to me, that really goes to the heart of what we're all about. I think postponing an election is a very tough thing. I know they're doing — because they've been in touch with us — they're doing it very carefully. They're spreading people out very — at great distances, as you can see. And I think they'll do it very safely. I hope they do it very safely."
4845,2020-04-05,"But I think postponing elections is a very — it's not a very good thing. They have lots of room in a lot of the electoral places, and I think that they will do it very well. But I think postponing is unnecessary."
4846,2020-04-05,"We think about it. We think about it. If we don't have to do it, that'll be good. We have very strong emergency powers when it comes to something like this, both on the southern and the northern borders. And we — we are talking about different things, but we'll see. Right now we have not decided to do that."
4847,2020-04-05,Steve?
4848,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
4849,2020-04-05,To Dr. Fauci.
4850,2020-04-05,"Yeah, no. The market — the market will take care of itself. The market will be very strong, as soon as we get rid of the virus. Yes."
4851,2020-04-05,"No, I haven't heard that. I haven't heard that from Devin or anybody else. Haven't heard it."
4852,2020-04-05,Haven't heard it.
4853,2020-04-05,"Well, I have to see what they said. But —"
4854,2020-04-05,"Well, I would disagree with it. But right now, we don't have an order, one way or the other. We don't have an order. But I think it's probably better that you don't, especially in certain areas. Oklahoma doesn't have a tremendous problem. Oklaho- — you said the governor of — the governor of Oklahoma?"
4855,2020-04-05,"And Devin. Yeah. Well, I hadn't heard that."
4856,2020-04-05,"Well, it's adverse to what the professionals are saying. That's, you know —"
4857,2020-04-05,"Yeah. No, it's adverse. But I'll take a look at it. Absolutely."
4858,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4859,2020-04-05,"Oh, please."
4860,2020-04-05,Please.
4861,2020-04-05,Do you want to answer that?
4862,2020-04-05,"Well, we haven't said that yet."
4863,2020-04-05,"We're recommending, but — we're recommending things."
4864,2020-04-05,"No, we haven't gone to that step yet. That could happen, but we haven't gone there yet. Please."
4865,2020-04-05,"Well, hopefully this will —"
4866,2020-04-05,"— pass through and hopefully that we'll have –- everybody will be going to restaurants and flying and being on cruise ships and all of these different things that we do. And it will very, very hopefully be in a fairly quick period of time. But we're taking a tough stance. We may make certain other decisions. We may enhance those decisions. We're going to find out."
4867,2020-04-05,"As per the question that you were asking, some of those decisions may be enhanced."
4868,2020-04-05,How about one more? Jennifer?
4869,2020-04-05,Yeah.
4870,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
4871,2020-04-05,"One thing Mike just said, it's very important to get out that this is for the next — what we're talking about — much of what we're talking about is for the next 15 days."
4872,2020-04-05,"Mike, go ahead."
4873,2020-04-05,"Just one more. Steve, go ahead. Please."
4874,2020-04-05,"Yeah, we had a G7 —"
4875,2020-04-05,It was a —
4876,2020-04-05,"Well, it looks like it. We're —"
4877,2020-04-05,"I've very confident. They're in a position that — some of them are in a rough position, if you look at a couple of them. And some are heading toward pretty rough territory."
4878,2020-04-05,"We had a very good conference; it was a teleconference. Everybody was on the phone — every leader. And almost 100 percent was devoted to the subject that we're talking about today. And they are working very hard. And they're — you know, they're very concerned, obviously, but they're working very hard."
4879,2020-04-05,"But I would say just about all of it was — Steve, all of it was devoted to what we're talking about."
4880,2020-04-05,"I think so. I mean, so far, it seems. We haven't — we didn't even discuss that. It's still a ways off. But it was a very good discussion. And they have — there's a great camaraderie. There's a great togetherness. I think it was — I think I can say that very, very strongly."
4881,2020-04-05,Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
4882,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you. Progress being made. And I appreciate you all joining us."
4883,2020-04-05,"Last night, the FDA announced groundbreaking new policies to further increase testing very substantially so. All states can now authorize tests developed and used within their borders, in addition to the FDA. So the states are very much involved. They have been involved from the beginning. But we're stepping it up as much as we can, and the testing procedures are going well."
4884,2020-04-05,"And within a short period of time, all other private labs will kick in. This has never been done before, and it's going to be something very — I think it's going to be incredible if it's done properly. And these are great companies. These are among the greatest companies in the world, actually."
4885,2020-04-05,"So the states are going to be dealing through themselves and with local government, local physicians, local everybody. They're also dealing with us. But we have a tremendous testing capacity."
4886,2020-04-05,"Today, we're also announcing a dramatic expansion of our Medicare telehealth services. Medicare patients can now visit any doctor by phone or video conference at no additional cost, including with commonly used services like FaceTime and Skype — a historic breakthrough. This has not been done before either. In addition, states have the authority to cover telehealth services for their medical patients. And by doing this, the patient is not seeing the doctor, per se, but they're seeing the doctor. So there's no getting close."
4887,2020-04-05,"During this time, we will not enforce applicable HIPAA penalties so that doctors can greatly expand care for their patients using telehealth. So the penalties won't be enforced. We encourage everyone to maximize use of telehealth to limit exposure to the virus. It's been a very successful method of communication but never used on a scale like we're going to use on telehealth. And you'll be able to also better maintain hospital capacity by doing this."
4888,2020-04-05,"Earlier this morning, I spoke with executives from America's fast-food industry — Wendy's, McDonald's, all of the big ones, Burger King — and they were great. We were talking about the pick-ups in light of yesterday's guidance, you heard, to avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, or public food courts. We discussed the important role that the drive-through, pick-up, and delivery service can play in the weeks ahead."
4889,2020-04-05,"So that's happening, and they have been fantastic. They have been absolutely fantastic. And they've been doing it already. But they're keeping it open and smaller staffs. They're very capable people and very capable companies, and they're doing it, the pick-ups."
4890,2020-04-05,"Our guidance yesterday urges Americans to take action for 15 days to help stem the outbreak. So it's a 15-day period. I guess, now I would say it's a 14-day period. It was 15 days from yesterday, and we're asking everyone to work at home, if possible, postpone unnecessary travel, and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people. By making shared sacrifices and temporary changes, we can protect the health of our people and we can protect our economy, because I think our economy will come back very rapidly. So it's 15 days from yesterday. We'll see what happens after that. If we do this right, our country — and the world, frankly — but our country can be rolling again pretty quickly. Pretty quickly."
4891,2020-04-05,"We have to fight that invisible enemy that, I guess, unknown but we're getting to know it a lot better."
4892,2020-04-05,"Today, the Senate is taking up coronavirus legislation that includes free testing for those who need it, as well as paid sick leave and family medical leave for workers affected by the virus. We're also committed to getting small businesses the support that they need. In fact, one of the things we talked about with the fast food operations — we spoke to the chairmen and CEOs of all of the companies — but one of the things we discussed is exactly that: getting small businesses support and flexibility that they need for themselves and for their workers, and that's being worked on right now."
4893,2020-04-05,"At my direction, Secretary Mnuchin is meeting today with senators on additional stimulus packages. I can tell you he was meeting with them late until the night, last night, and for a big part of the day yesterday, and tremendous things are happening. There's great spirit. Tremendous spirit. And I can say that for Republicans and Democrats."
4894,2020-04-05,"I can say that, with respect to Governor Cuomo, we had a great talk this morning. We're both doing a really good job, and we're coordinating it. And we agree — you know, different states need different things. And we — we agree on that 100 percent. But we had a very good talk, and I think we're right down the same track, and it's going to be very successful."
4895,2020-04-05,"New York has a pretty big problem. I guess, would be the number one hotspot. It's no fault of anybody. It's just the way it is. But we're working very closely together. We're also getting FEMA very much involved. They've been involved, but now we're getting them to a different level, and we'll have everything ready. We're dealing with the Army Corps of Engineers should that be necessary. We have them working, in some cases; on standby, in other cases."
4896,2020-04-05,"But my conversation with Andrew Cuomo was a very, very productive one and a very good one. And I appreciate that."
4897,2020-04-05,"We're giving relief to affected industries and small businesses, and we're ensuring that we emerge from this challenge with a prosperous and growing economy because that's what's going to happen. It's going to pop. One day, we'll be standing, possibly up here, and we'll say, “Well, we won.” And we're going to say that. As sure as you're sitting there, we're going to say that. And we're going to win, and I think we're going to win faster than people think, I hope."
4898,2020-04-05,"Later today, I'll meet with the leaders from the tourism industry, as well as industrial supply retailers and wholesalers, to discuss their critical roles. As you know, I met with the department store people, all of the retailers — the big ones, including Walmart and others — and it was a great meeting. They're stocking up their stores like they've never stocked them before. We're trying to get people to actually buy less if that's possible. Buy less. Don't take everything. Just buy what you need for a while. It's — they're going to stay open all hours of the day. And they've really been — they've been fantastic."
4899,2020-04-05,"We're taking aggressive action now as one nation and one family so that America can rebound stronger — frankly, stronger than ever before. And we recognize that while many American workers can work from home, many others cannot. Many of our healthcare providers, first responders, and men and women in the food service and manufacturing are showing at — they're showing up and standing up to provide us with the goods and services we need."
4900,2020-04-05,"So we want people to stay home where they can, but in many cases, when you talk about food service and manufacturing, certain items in particular, they are — they're going in and they're practicing all of the safety rules and regulations that we talk about."
4901,2020-04-05,"So with that, I'd like to just introduce our great Vice President, Mike Pence. He'll say a few words, and then I'll make some other introductions."
4902,2020-04-05,Thank you very much.
4903,2020-04-05,"Thank you, Mike, very much. Thank you."
4904,2020-04-05,"I want to thank Chad Wolf and Homeland Security. The job they did at the airports was really incredible. They screened thousands and thousands of people. O'Hare got backed up, but — a little bit, but they got them out. But everybody was screened and screened very carefully. They didn't want to rush it. I think it was 13 airports. And it was — it was an incredible thing. Then they had a big surge also from the UK and Ireland, and that went very smoothly. But they did a fantastic job. They worked long hours and they did a fantastic job."
4905,2020-04-05,"I'd like to introduce Steve Mnuchin, and then I'm going to ask Steve to leave because he's going to the Hill. He's been working very hard with the Senate and with — actually, with the House on a very, very big, bold package. It's going to be big and it's going to be bold. And the level, again, of enthusiasm to get something done, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it."
4906,2020-04-05,"So, Steve Mnuchin, please."
4907,2020-04-05,Do you have any questions for the Secretary of the Treasury?
4908,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please.
4909,2020-04-05,Please. Wait. Please.
4910,2020-04-05,The airline industry will be in good shape.
4911,2020-04-05,"Yeah. Go ahead, please."
4912,2020-04-05,"Well, I think — I think we're going to do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible. That may not be an accurate way of doing it, because obviously some people shouldn't be getting checks for $1,000. And we'll have a pretty good idea by the end of the day, what we're going to be doing."
4913,2020-04-05,"John, please."
4914,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I have to say this: There are four different ways you can do it —"
4915,2020-04-05,"That's okay. Four — you can hear me well enough, I imagine."
4916,2020-04-05,"Okay. Oh, the people at home, you're right. Those are very important people, come to think of it."
4917,2020-04-05,Especially your people.
4918,2020-04-05,"Look, we have four or five ways we can do it — four ways in particular. I think there's a fifth possibility. But there are some very good ways of getting the money out and getting it out quickly. A payroll tax is one way, but it does come over a period of months, many months, and we want to do something much faster than that. So I think we have ways of getting money out pretty quickly and very accurately."
4919,2020-04-05,Okay?
4920,2020-04-05,"We don't want to talk about it, but it's a substantial number. We're going big. The expression — we could do it two ways; we could keep going back every day or every week. We're going big. And that's where Mitch McConnell — that's the way he wants to go. That's the way I want to go. I think we want to get it done and have a big infusion as opposed to going through little meetings every — every couple of days. We don't want to do it that way. We want to go big, go solid."
4921,2020-04-05,"The country is very strong. We've never been so strong. And that's what we're going to be doing. We don't want — with this invisible enemy, we don't want airlines going out of business. We don't want people losing their jobs or not having money to live, when they were doing very well just four weeks ago."
4922,2020-04-05,"So we're going big, and that's the way it'll be. And that's the way everybody seems to like it on the Hill."
4923,2020-04-05,Any other question for Steve?
4924,2020-04-05,"Thanks, Steve."
4925,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
4926,2020-04-05,"And the banks are record-setting strong. So we have — we have that, which is a much different event than what we had not so long ago."
4927,2020-04-05,"John, go ahead, please."
4928,2020-04-05,Right.
4929,2020-04-05,Right.
4930,2020-04-05,"Well, we've been asked to, and we're —"
4931,2020-04-05,"Yes, we're starting to. We're starting the process. And it's a process — we hope it's not going to be necessary, but it could be necessary. The state is working on it very hard themselves, but we'll probably supplement what they're doing."
4932,2020-04-05,"No, I don't see that at all. And I think China has every incentive to make sure that things work well. China wants to make sure that things work very well. They have every incentive to do so."
4933,2020-04-05,Jon?
4934,2020-04-05,"Well, the governor of Ohio is doing a great job. He called that off, and we'll see what happens. There's a court case, and it hasn't been fully determined yet. But if he called it off, I could understand that because, you know, he — he's definitely somebody that knows what he's doing."
4935,2020-04-05,"We'll be seeing what — very soon. You know, they're going by the rule of 10 as opposed to 50, and that's pretty tough. I would say, probably, you could violate that if you wanted to for an election. I just think an election is a very special thing. He's going to choose — he chose a different date. I think a date that sometime in June."
4936,2020-04-05,But that would be a decision that would be made by him. He felt it was necessary. The courts are — somebody is challenging it. So the courts will ultimately decide.
4937,2020-04-05,Yeah. What I'm doing —
4938,2020-04-05,"What I'm going, Jon, is very simple. We're getting rid of this virus. That's what we're doing. That's the best thing we can do."
4939,2020-04-05,"By the way, for the markets, for everything — it's very simple, very simple solution. We want to get rid of it. We want to have very — as few deaths as possible. This is a horrible thing."
4940,2020-04-05,You look at what's going on with Italy. We don't want to be in a position like that. But a much larger — because we're a much larger country. We don't want to be there.
4941,2020-04-05,"And I think we've done really well. I think we've done well. I think the states have done well. We're all working together. The best thing we can do is get rid of the virus. Once that's gone, it's going to pop back like nobody has ever seen before. That's my opinion, but I think it'll pop back like nobody has ever seen before."
4942,2020-04-05,Please.
4943,2020-04-05,"Right. We've ordered massive numbers of ventilators. We have — by any normal standards, we have a lot of respirators, ventilators. We have tremendous amounts of equipment. But compared to what we're talking about here, this has never been done before."
4944,2020-04-05,"And yesterday I gave the governors the right to go order directly if they want, if they feel they can do it faster than going through the federal government."
4945,2020-04-05,"Now, we've knocked out all of the bureaucracy; it's very direct, but it's still always faster to order directly. And I gave them — that was totally misinterpreted by the New York Times, on purpose, unfortunately."
4946,2020-04-05,But the — but it's very important.
4947,2020-04-05,"Yes, Mike."
4948,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Yeah."
4949,2020-04-05,The Army Corps is very prepared to do as we say. And we're looking at where it's going.
4950,2020-04-05,"But — and they do call them MASH hospitals, but the field hospitals go up very quickly. They're — we have them. We have all of this equipment in stock. And we're looking at different sites in a few different locations."
4951,2020-04-05,"And we're not going to need them in West Virginia where, so far, I guess they have none. Still none? Still none, right? West Virginia."
4952,2020-04-05,Q No known cases.
4953,2020-04-05,"Big Jim, the governor, is — he must be doing a good job."
4954,2020-04-05,That's what's reported. They —
4955,2020-04-05,"Well, that's all that — I just see West Virginia is the only one that has no cases. So, obviously, that's being treated differently than a New York or a California — different parts of California."
4956,2020-04-05,"I do say this, though: The Army Corps of Engineers is ready, willing, and able. We have to give them the go-ahead if we find that it's going to be necessary. We think we can have quite a few units up very rapidly. I'm going to work with Governor Cuomo. I'm going to work with a number of the governors. Governor Newsom has been very generous in his words, and I'm being generous to him, too, because we're all working together very well. And I think a lot of very positive things have taken place. We're talking to California about different sites. But we can have a lot of units up fairly quickly if we think we need them."
4957,2020-04-05,"I think what I'll do is, I might ask Seema to say a few words on the telehealth, and then we can back to this."
4958,2020-04-05,Please. Seema?
4959,2020-04-05,Any questions? Please.
4960,2020-04-05,Will you be posting numbers also?
4961,2020-04-05,"That might be the easiest way to do it — if you post in ads, if you post some numbers."
4962,2020-04-05,Thank you. Thank you very much.
4963,2020-04-05,"Admiral, if you'd say a few words about where we're going, and then I'd like to ask Dr. Birx to say a couple of words about how the system is working."
4964,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Thank you, Admiral."
4965,2020-04-05,"And this has never been done before. And it sets a great roadmap for future, should we have something like this in the future. I hope we don't. But it's never been done before, and they've done an incredible job."
4966,2020-04-05,"Again, we're working with the states and relying on the states. We have to because they — they have — it's point of sale, it's point of site. And we're in, I think, just about every instance, getting along really well with the states."
4967,2020-04-05,"If I could, Dr. Birx, if you could say a couple of words, please."
4968,2020-04-05,"It's a big thing. Right, Doctor? Maybe a couple of questions."
4969,2020-04-05,"Yes, Jim."
4970,2020-04-05,"Please, John. Him."
4971,2020-04-05,Okay.
4972,2020-04-05,And we've been very tough on those states. I know exactly who you're talking about. We've been very tough on them. Thank you.
4973,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
4974,2020-04-05,And the states are actually doing a lot of this. The governors and the states are doing a lot of it with even our tests.
4975,2020-04-05,"Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, please."
4976,2020-04-05,"It's possible. It's possible. We'll see how it goes. I think a lot of — there's been great cooperation with local governments, states. We'll see how it goes. It's going — it's going, right now, pretty well."
4977,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please go ahead."
4978,2020-04-05,Please. Yeah.
4979,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
4980,2020-04-05,"Well, we're able to do that if we have to. Right now, we haven't had to, but it's certainly ready. If I want it, we can do it very quickly. We've studied it very closely over two weeks ago, actually. We'll make that decision pretty quickly if we need it. We hope we don't need it. It's a big step."
4981,2020-04-05,"Well, when you say the states — in particular, three states need some help. And some states, you know, have two people, three people — no people, in the case of, again, West Virginia."
4982,2020-04-05,"So we're looking at it very closely. We've taken it apart 15 different ways. It's a very difficult thing to do. It's a very big step. And if we need that step, we'll take it, okay?"
4983,2020-04-05,"I would just say: Enjoy your home. Stay. I would just say, right now, we — we have to get this problem fixed, and then we'll get back into business really quick. We'll open up our country, we'll open up our society. The world will hopefully open up."
4984,2020-04-05,"We see areas of the world that are — that haven't done well, and we see areas that are doing very well. And I would put us in the category of doing very well for a country so big. I think that I would recommend that they just enjoy their living room."
4985,2020-04-05,Jon?
4986,2020-04-05,"Yeah, sure. I'm not happy with those people if they're not. But, you know, those people are being shouted down by other people. They know it. They're being — it's almost like self-policing. People went in, and there are couple of instances, I guess — probably more than a couple — where people are not happy when they see others doing what they're not supposed to be doing."
4987,2020-04-05,"We have to get rid of this. We have to win this war, and, ideally, quickly. Quickly. Because the longer it takes, it's not a good situation. And I'm not even talking about the economy. I'm talking about the lives of a lot of people."
4988,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please. Did you have one?"
4989,2020-04-05,"I'm going to ask — I think I'm going to ask Mike. Answer that question, please."
4990,2020-04-05,"We've had — we've had such incredible — I don't know, it's almost the word “spirit” is the best word. It's like a spirit."
4991,2020-04-05,The banks have come in and the banks are doing things that they would have never done. They're working on extensions and lots of things that they wouldn't have done.
4992,2020-04-05,"Co-pays, with regard to the insurance companies — I mean, for them to be doing what they're doing — and you know all about the co-pays — they would have never done that, and they did it. They were in my office. They — I would say the 11 biggest in this country; I guess, probably, the 11 biggest in the world. The big ones, all the big ones. And they — they did things on co-pay that nobody would be doing, that they wouldn't have done in a million years, but they're doing it. There's a great spirit going on right now in the country."
4993,2020-04-05,"So you want — yes, please."
4994,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
4995,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
4996,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Go ahead.
4997,2020-04-05,Right.
4998,2020-04-05,"We're looking at many ideas. That's one of them, frankly. And we're looking at creating incentives for companies — not only that type of company, but other companies."
4999,2020-04-05,"We're also looking to help companies, such as the airline industry — within the airline industry. And we'll be doing that. We will be doing that. This is not their fault. And they've been very understanding, actually. And we're going to be helping them. We will have a very powerful airline industry, and it'll start up as soon as this is over. We'll — we'll have those — we'll have those planes ready to go. So we have to help them during the short term with — very important."
5000,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
5001,2020-04-05,Right.
5002,2020-04-05,We look at every model. We've relied on the very talented people. And there's no better team than the people behind me. And I will say that all of the people that have done those models are all in constant touch with Dr. Birx and Tony and everybody that you've been hearing so much from over the last couple of weeks.
5003,2020-04-05,"We've looked at — we've looked at many different models. And the model we have is, we want to save a lot of lives. We want to save a lot of lives. If we get too steep on that curve, you're going to lose a lot of lives, perhaps unnecessarily."
5004,2020-04-05,"Now, we're going to find out. Everything has a risk. We're going to see. But if people do what we're telling them to do, what we're asking them to do, you're going to see the saving of a lot of lives."
5005,2020-04-05,"Now, Boris, in UK yesterday — you saw what happened — it looked like they were going a different way, but then he went a way of similar — I guess similar — I don't know exactly. But I would say we had a conversation yesterday, similar to what we're doing."
5006,2020-04-05,So a lot of people seem to think this is going to be — we are — we are looking to save the maximum number of lives. Everything else is going to come back. A life is never going to come back. But everything else — our economy is going to come roaring back.
5007,2020-04-05,"You're going to know, we're going to know — we're going all know that day. Somebody was asking about the day, “When will you know? When will you know?” We're going to know. All of a sudden, we're going to say, “Wow, that's looking good. That's looking good. That's looking good.” And we're going to be on the other side of the curve. And that's a day that we look forward to. Okay?"
5008,2020-04-05,"No, I don't think so. This is where we were going. I really think, from the beginning, this is where we were going. This is what we had in mind. We were just — we're just going step by step. That was the next step — the next logical step."
5009,2020-04-05,"As Dr. Fauci said — and I think very importantly — one of the most important things, when you write the history of this, was the fact that we closed it down to China and Europe, but in particular, China. We closed it down to China, the source, very, very early. Very, very early. Far earlier than even the great professionals wanted to do. And I think, in the end, that's going to be — that will have saved a tremendous number of lives."
5010,2020-04-05,"I didn't think — I mean, I have seen that, where people actually liked it. But I didn't feel different. I've always known this is a — this is a real — this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do is look at other countries. I think now it's in almost 120 countries all over the world."
5011,2020-04-05,"No, I've always viewed it as very serious. There was no difference yesterday from days before. I feel the tone is similar, but some people said it wasn't."
5012,2020-04-05,"It could be. I mean, I don't think in terms of recession. I think in terms of getting it out, because when we're finished with the virus, we will win. We will win."
5013,2020-04-05,"And when that victory takes place, our economy is going to go through the roof. It is so pent up. It is so built up. It is so ready to go in an upward direction. But we have to knock out this enemy. This is a really tough enemy, but we have to knock out — all of us. That's all of us."
5014,2020-04-05,"So I don't think in terms of recession. Not recession. It's words. We have to knock out this, and we will have an economy — I actually think we'll have an economy like we've never had before. It's all pent up."
5015,2020-04-05,"Did you have something to say, Mike? Please."
5016,2020-04-05,"In other words, reduce the number of people that die. That's what we're trying to do. And when you do the steep curve, a lot of people are going to die. A lot of people."
5017,2020-04-05,"You know, the worst ever, they say: 1918. And I don't have to go into the numbers, but they were unbelievable numbers. Had they known and had they done what we had now, it would have been a very much different story. It would still be tragic, but it would have been a very much different. But that was — that was the one that people write about. That was an incredible — that was an incredible pandemic like we haven't seen."
5018,2020-04-05,"But we have — we have done something that I hope — hopefully, we will all have made the right moves. We're all in this together, including you, and we want to see fair press. And I tell you what: It's been — generally speaking, I think it's been — it's been a great thing to see."
5019,2020-04-05,"It's been very, very — the — getting along with Democrats, getting along with Republicans, for the Democrats themselves — there's been a lot of spirit. There's been a lot of things happening that I haven't seen happen in the first almost now three and a half years. It's been very nice to see. That's one of the good things."
5020,2020-04-05,"But, really, the good thing is we have to knock it out. We have to win. And we want to keep that slope as low as possible because that's a lot of lives in there."
5021,2020-04-05,"Let's go back there. Somebody that didn't get one. Please, go ahead."
5022,2020-04-05,"Well, they need our product very badly and — no, I haven't received any. We have a good relationship with China. I have not received anything to that. No, we have a signed agreement. They're going to be buying and they have been buying a lot of product."
5023,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
5024,2020-04-05,Right.
5025,2020-04-05,"Well, I'll know the point. And by speaking with Governor Cuomo and other governors, we're going to know the point. It's going to be different for New York than it's going to be for, you know, Iowa or from Idaho or from West Virginia, frankly, or for — you know, it's different. New York has got a big problem. The State of Washington has a big problem. California has some big problems."
5026,2020-04-05,"Everyone is doing a good job. But we're going to know when it will be, and I believe it'll be more spot than it will be — it's not going to be the whole thing; it's going to be spots. There are some hotspots that are in trouble — big trouble. And there are other areas that are in no trouble at all. They watch it on television. They don't know — you know, it's just not affecting them and that's — they're lucky. They're lucky. But there are areas of the country that don't have much of a problem and some that don't have any problem. They're not going to have a problem with hospitals."
5027,2020-04-05,"But some areas — like New York, California, State of Washington — they're going to have some difficulty. And when we see that coming, we're going to be in there. We're already making preparation for it."
5028,2020-04-05,"Well, we're looking at different things, John. I don't want to say exactly. Right now, China has been sending us everything we need. But we are — we're looking at some alternatives. Yes, we are looking for alternatives."
5029,2020-04-05,"And we have other places. Ireland does a lot of work for us — you know that — in that world, in the pharma world. A very tremendous producer. And we are looking to bring a lot more back home."
5030,2020-04-05,"And I've been — excuse me, you know me for a long time; I've been talking about this for many years. Long before I decided to run for President, I've been talking about this. And we have to be able to take care of our country. And that was one of the many things on the list. So we'll be talking about it."
5031,2020-04-05,"But we are — we are discussing it, and Marco is very much involved and Peter is very much involved. A lot of people are involved, and a lot of people feel that way. But we'll be discussing."
5032,2020-04-05,Let's go. Please.
5033,2020-04-05,Not to the United States.
5034,2020-04-05,"Well, Canada has not closed it to the United States."
5035,2020-04-05,"So we're working very closely with Canada and — but they have not closed it. They have closed it to the world, but they have not closed it to the United States."
5036,2020-04-05,"I don't want to say that, but we are discussing things with Canada, and we're discussing things with Mexico, quite honestly. And, again, the relationship is outstanding with both. Outstanding. We just signed our deal — the USMCA — and the relationship is very strong."
5037,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
5038,2020-04-05,"Well, China was putting out information, which was false, that our military gave this to them. That was false. And rather than having an argument, I said I have to call it where it came from; it did come from China. So I think it's a very accurate term. But, no, I didn't appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them. Our military did not give — give it to anybody."
5039,2020-04-05,"No, I don't think so. No, I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma."
5040,2020-04-05,Please.
5041,2020-04-05,"Well, we're going to help. They need help. Look, let's face it. You know, they go from having record-breaking years — this is the third year of record-breaking years — travel and tourism, airlines, everything. They were doing record numbers, ordering new planes, building new hotels. Everything was really hunky-dory."
5042,2020-04-05,"And then, one day, we hear about this rumor in China. And then, we find out it's much more than a rumor. And then, all of a sudden, we make a great decision to close it up early. It would be a whole different world. It would be a whole different world. But we make a decision to close it up to China, and all of a sudden, tourism and — and then we close it up to Europe, which, you know, people never heard of this before. I'm not sure that that's ever been done. I know that when I made the decision to close it to China, people told me that's never been done before, but it was a great decision."
5043,2020-04-05,"We make good decisions. So, I'll tell you my best decision: The people behind me are total pros. All over the world, they're respected — Dr. Birx; Anthony, who has become a — where is Anthony? — become a major television star for — for all the right reasons. No, he's just so professional. So good."
5044,2020-04-05,"The people that we have working here have been incredible. And they're totally respected. The Admiral has been incredible, having to do with the testing. Incredible. And he's viewing this as testing also for the future. We're building a platform."
5045,2020-04-05,"When we took over this platform, the first thing the Admiral said was, “This was not designed for what we're talking about — millions of people.” It wasn't. And it's nobody's fault. It's not like — who could have ever predicted a thing like this? But we broke it down and it's really going to be an incredible system. And it is now a great system."
5046,2020-04-05,"I just — I just want to say, these are people standing behind me. They're the most respected in the world. Every country that you've mentioned today so far has called them, and they call them all of the time for advice. There is nobody better than what we have."
5047,2020-04-05,Say it.
5048,2020-04-05,I don't know. I can't imagine —
5049,2020-04-05,I can tell you he's doing a good job. We're very happy with him.
5050,2020-04-05,Please. You haven't. Go ahead.
5051,2020-04-05,Right.
5052,2020-04-05,It wasn't about the payroll tax. Q Did that inform your decision? What — what made you make that change? And when did you make that change?
5053,2020-04-05,"Well, I didn't make a change. We're looking at payroll tax. And we're looking at various other forms of getting money to people. And the payroll tax is something that I've always liked. The problem is it does take a period of time — you know, months — before they really see something. And we don't really have months, in terms of people living. You know, a lot of these — you have people that work on tips. You have people in our — it's a large number of people. It's a tremendous — who would think this, right? And they do nicely. They work very hard, but they work on tips."
5054,2020-04-05,"We have to take care of our people. We don't want to have people suffering during this period. It wasn't their fault that this thing, all of a sudden, was upon us. So we're looking at various — we're also looking at payroll tax. You know, it's possible. It's also possible we'll do a percentage of payroll tax and then other things. But we'd like to be able to get money to people."
5055,2020-04-05,"You know, we're very lucky our country is doing so well, we can do this and we can do it easily. But we have to do it. And I have to say, Mitch McConnell — if you look at Mitch and Kevin and the whole group, it's been — it's been incredible how they're reacting, how Congress is reacting, how — whether it's the House or Senate, how they're moving. And I'm talking about Democrats and Republicans."
5056,2020-04-05,"But we've had tremendous leadership meetings, and they want to see it done right and they do want to go big. I think going big is important. I don't think we want to go up there every day with a different idea, a different concept. “Oh, gee, let's worry about the airlines. Let's do this one.” You have a big problem with the cruise ship industry. It's an industry that was setting all sorts of records two months ago. And then, all of a sudden, there is nobody on the ships. Okay?"
5057,2020-04-05,"So we have to help these. These are great industries. These are going to be taking care of people and passengers and — and for years to come. And paying tremendous taxes — tremendous taxes for years to come. So, we have to make sure this is done."
5058,2020-04-05,"Yes, Jon."
5059,2020-04-05,"I only do that when I have to respond. I watched her on television. She said something that was false and therefore I did do that. And I will continue to do that if they're not going to play fair. Because, you know, they have the media on their side; I don't. I just have me."
5060,2020-04-05,"And if they're not going to play fair, I'm going to do that. If they are going to play fair, there's going to be nobody —"
5061,2020-04-05,"There's going to be nobody better than Donald Trump, in terms of bipartisanship. But if they're going to say things that are false, like the story that was written yesterday. A lot of people — I don't know — somebody — I think I know who — but they taped the conference call that I had with the governors. It was a good call. It was fine. I assumed somebody is going to tape it. They handed it to various people, and one of them was the New York Times and the New York Times chose to write totally inaccurately about it. It was a disgraceful thing. It was bad journalism, but, you know, they do a lot of bad journalism. But we respond to that and, actually, people get it. People get it."
5062,2020-04-05,"No, I want it to be bipartisan and nobody's going to be better than me. But when they attack me or the people — these incredible people behind me — I'm not going to let them get away with that. I can't do that."
5063,2020-04-05,"Okay, how about one or two more questions? Go ahead, please. Please."
5064,2020-04-05,"Well, you can do a national lockdown. Hopefully, we are not going to need that. We think of everything. I mean, we have — every idea that you mentioned, we've thought of. And, you know, that's a very big step. That's a step that, I mean, in one sense would work. It's a very big step. It's something we talk about, but we haven't decided to do that."
5065,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
5066,2020-04-05,"It would have to get to a level — I just don't think it's going to be an action that we're going to take. I don't think I'll talk — but Anthony, all of the people standing behind, we'd get together in a room, plus some additionals, and we would make a decision. But I don't think that's a step that we're going to be taking."
5067,2020-04-05,"But one more question. You didn't have one, did you? Come on."
5068,2020-04-05,"We're looking at that. We're certainly looking at Boeing. Boeing got hit hard in many different ways. Boeing never had a problem. For — for years, they were — they were an incredible — an incre- — they were — it was unthinkable what happened, with respect to Boeing. Unthinkable. Probably, I would consider it the greatest company in the world prior to a year ago. Now they get hit in 15 different ways and they have different management. I've met the new people running Boeing. I think it's going to be outstanding."
5069,2020-04-05,"But, yeah, we have to protect Boeing. We have to absolutely help — help Boeing. They were doing a job. They were getting — it was coming along well. And then all of a sudden, this hits. So, obviously, when the airlines aren't doing well, Boeing is not going to be doing well. So we'll be helping Boeing. Yeah."
5070,2020-04-05,"Well, that's what I heard. And I'm going to let — I'm going to let Tony answer that question. Or some- — whoever is best at answering that. But I do have to say, when you talk about politics — I watched the debate. Not too exciting. But what they said about me — and we've done a great job. When you talk about not — not being bipartisan — what they said about me."
5071,2020-04-05,"And if you look at swine flu — the whole thing in, I guess it was 2009, and what they did and the mistakes they've made, they were terrible. They were horrific mistakes. Seventeen thousand people died. And I'll be honest, they shouldn't be criticizing because we've done a fantastic job."
5072,2020-04-05,"The only thing we haven't done well is to get good press. We've done a fantastic job, but it hasn't been appreciated. Even the — the closing down of the borders, which had never been done — and not only did we close them, but we closed them early — the press doesn't like writing about it."
5073,2020-04-05,"So we've done a poor job on press relationships and, you know, I guess, I don't know who to blame for that. I don't know, maybe I can blame — maybe I can blame ourselves for that. I will blame ourselves. But I think we've done a great job. I think we've done a poor job, in terms of press relationship."
5074,2020-04-05,But let me have somebody answer your question.
5075,2020-04-05,Good answer. That's a good answer. Would you have something on that?
5076,2020-04-05,That's what I heard too.
5077,2020-04-05,"So, number one, nothing was offered. Number two, it was a bad test. Otherwise, it was wonderful."
5078,2020-04-05,"Listen, thank you very much."
5079,2020-04-05,No he made a mistake. I assume — I assume that he'll apologize. He made a mistake.
5080,2020-04-05,Thank you all very much. Thank you. We'll be back. Thank you.
5081,2020-04-05,"It's a busy time. Very busy time. And let me begin by again expressing our support, solidarity, and love for the people of our great country. We're fighting for you and we're enduring all of this together. And we will soon prevail together. We're making a lot of progress."
5082,2020-04-05,"We appreciate all of the great assistance from the governors and people within the states. The relationships have been, really, very good. I spoke with Governor Cuomo. We're working very hard to get additional things to New York as quickly as possible."
5083,2020-04-05,"We — as you know, we took care of the hospital, including personnel — the 2,500 beds that we build just recently at Javits, including personnel. And we opened it up to COVID, and that's something that we also did in Louisiana, and we're doing it in Dallas."
5084,2020-04-05,"So we have a lot of not only hospitals being built, but now we're manning the hospitals because states are, in many cases, unable to get additional people to work. It's — it's just an incredible situation. There's never been anything like this."
5085,2020-04-05,"One of the most important issues in battling this pandemic is coordinating the delivery of the crucial supplies throughout the nation based upon the most accurate information available. And we've got the best healthcare and disaster experts anywhere in the world, and everybody will tell you that, and we're dealing with big parts of the world on helping them also through this horrible situation where 151 — still, 151 nations are going through it."
5086,2020-04-05,"We're working to ensure that the supplies are delivered where and when they're needed, and in some cases, we're telling governors we can't go there because we don't think you need it and we think someplace else needs it. And pretty much, so far, we've been right about that. And we'll continue to do it."
5087,2020-04-05,"As it really gets — this will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week. And there'll be a lot of death, unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn't done. But there will be death."
5088,2020-04-05,"We're looking for an obvious focus in the hardest-hit regions. Some of them are obvious and some aren't so obvious. They spring up. They come and they — they hit you like you got hit by a club, an area that wasn't at all bothered. You look at what's going on in New Jersey — the governor is doing an excellent job, by the way — but how that sprang up."
5089,2020-04-05,"Every decision that we're making is made to save lives. It's really our sole consideration. We want to save lives. We want as few lives lost as possible. It's therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public. It's just incredible. I could name them, but it's the same ones. Always the same ones. I guess they're looking for ratings. I don't know what they're looking for. So bad for our country and so bad — the people understand it. You look at the levels and approval ratings, and they're the lowest they've ever been for media. It's so bad for — for our country. So bad for the world. You ought to put it together for a little while, get this over with, and then go back to your fake news."
5090,2020-04-05,"During a national emergency, it's just essential that the federal decision makers cut through the fog of confusion in order to follow the facts and the science. Many hospital administrators that we've been in touch with, even in the really hotspots — you know what they are — are communicating directly with us that their level of supplies are meeting essential needs. And at the current time, they're really thrilled to be where they are. Whenever local shortages are reported, we're asking states to immediately meet the demand. And we're stockpiling large amounts in different areas — in different areas. And we're going to be discussing that in a little while."
5091,2020-04-05,"But we want distributions to be made on a fair basis. We have to take care of a large country, not just certain areas of the country. But no matter where we're — we've been there and we've been there very strongly. I want to thank FEMA. I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers. I want to thank our military for what they're doing."
5092,2020-04-05,"And we're going to be adding a tremendous amount of military to help supplement the states — thousands of soldiers, thousands of medical workers, professionals, nurses, doctors. And it'll be a large number. It'll be — we'll be telling them over the next very short period where they're going. And they're going into war. They're going into a battle that they've never really trained for. Nobody has trained for this; nobody has seen this, I would say, since 1917, which was the greatest of them all. The greatest of this type of battle. Probably the greatest of them all. Right? 1917. Up to 100 million people were killed."
5093,2020-04-05,"In addition, we're working directly with hospitals and existing suppliers and distributors to ensure that those with the greatest need are prioritized. And that need changes. One day it's one state or one locale, one city. And then all of a sudden, they're starting to do well. We had some very good reports coming out of the State of Washington, coming out of various parts of California — so, areas that we were getting ready to really hit hard. We can now go to other areas."
5094,2020-04-05,It looks like New York is going to be hit very hard. And Louisiana is just amazing the way it just sprang up. And everyone is doing a good job but they're going to be hit hard.
5095,2020-04-05,"Areas in the country that are not experiencing large-scale infections are requesting supplies beyond what their present circumstances require. And we talk to them and we tell them and we explain it, and for the most part they're good with it. We think we're right."
5096,2020-04-05,"It's very understandable that officials would seek to get the most they can get for their communities, but the fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests. We have some states and areas where they're just asking for far more. I mean, look, we had one state asking for 40,000 ventilators. Forty thousand. Think of it: 40,000. It's not possible. They won't need that many, and now they're admitting they don't need that many. But we're getting as many as we can to them."
5097,2020-04-05,"Again, nobody has ever seen anything like this in terms of ventilators, in terms of protective equipment and uniforms and outfits. But it makes it more difficult for distributors to prioritize the real need, and it could intentionally and, you know — look, they — everybody has proper intentions but they want to make sure they're 100 percent. And sometimes, when they know they don't need it, they want it anyway. It gives them that extra feeling of satisfaction, but we just can't do that. It's not even possible to think about it."
5098,2020-04-05,"And that's why — and we're a backup. Remember, we're a backup. We're the greatest backup that ever existed for the states, especially when we start getting into the hospital building business and getting into the medical center building business, where you see we built many hospitals — numerous hospitals in some states — and medical centers."
5099,2020-04-05,"That's why my administration has been requesting actual usage numbers directly from the states and hospitals to meet their needs, because we want to be ready when — when the brunt of it comes, which is coming quickly; you see it. You see it as sure as you can see it. And when the brunt of it comes, we want to be ready to hit the area that needs it. We don't want to have spent everything in one area, and they don't need it there to anywhere near the extent."
5100,2020-04-05,"So let me be extremely clear about one point: We will move heaven and earth to safeguard our great American citizens. We will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource we've got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure, and to get this thing over with. We want to finish this war. We have to get back to work. We have to get — we have to open our country again. We have to open our country again. We don't want to be doing this for months and months and months. We're going to open our country again. This country wasn't meant for this. Few were. Few were. But we have to open our country again."
5101,2020-04-05,"I just spoke with the commissioners, leaders of, I would say, virtually all of the sports leagues: Rob Manfred, Commissioner of Baseball, Major League Baseball; Roger Goodell Commissioner of the National Football League; Adam Silver Commissioner of the National Basketball Association; Gary Bettman, Commissioner of the National Hockey League; Jay Monahan, Commissioner of the PGA Tour; Cathy Engelbert, Commissioner of the Women's National Basketball Association; Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship; Vince McMahon President of the WWE; Don Garber, Commissioner of Major League Soccer; Steve Phelps, President of NASCAR; Michael Whan, Commissioner of the LPGA; Roger Penske, Founder and Chairman Penske Corp.; and Drew Fleming, President of the Breeders' Cup."
5102,2020-04-05,"And there were a couple of others on, and these are all the great leaders of sport. And they want to get back. They got to get back. They can't do this. Their sports weren't designed for it. The whole concept of our nation wasn't designed for it. We're going to have to get back. We want to get back soon — very soon."
5103,2020-04-05,"For example — and I have to say, we're using the Defense Production Act very powerfully. In some cas- — times directly; in many cases, indirectly. Just the threat of it is usually enough."
5104,2020-04-05,"But FEMA and HHS have ordered 180 million — think of that — 180 million. Who ever heard of 180 million N95 masks? And we're working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out, but we want them to help our country. And I think it's going to be okay. We're going to soon let you know. But we need the masks. We don't want other people getting it, and that's why we're — that's why we're instituting a lot of Defense Production Act, you could call it, retaliations because that's what it is; it's a retaliation."
5105,2020-04-05,"If people don't — if people don't give us what we need for our people, we're going to be very tough, and we've been very tough. Usually we don't have to use it, but we've used it plenty. It's turning out more and more, unfortunately. And it works very well."
5106,2020-04-05,"Our Supply Chain Logistics Task Force, led by Admiral John Polowczyk, who's doing a fantastic job, will ensure they're distributed to the healthcare and critical infrastructure workers in the areas with the most pressing requirements. That's the 60 million masks that we're talking about and the hundred and — 180 million N95 masks. A hundred and eighty million. Who ever heard of 180 million masks?"
5107,2020-04-05,"And this is a incredible thing. A lot of times — and we have to stop playing this game — if a governor wants 200 ventilators, and I say, “No, we're going to send you 1,000. We think you need more than 200,” and then the media meets with the governor and they say, “Oh, you got more. Well, it's not enough. The President should have sent more.” So he's asking for 200. We give him 1,000. They say, “How's the President doing?” “He should have given more.” Because that's politics. That's politics. And that's unfortunate, because we can't play that game."
5108,2020-04-05,"And, you know, that's one party doing it, and the other party is happy. But they're all really happy because they should have been doing this work themselves for a long period of time. Many of their cupboards were bare."
5109,2020-04-05,"With respect to the ventilators, FEMA and HHS continue to monitor the data on an hourly basis where provided by the states. In order to most effectively target the distribution of supplies, we've been asking states to provide us with daily updates on the number of ventilators and their utilization rates, because some states have more ventilators than they need. They don't even like to admit it. They'll admit it when everything is over, but that's — it doesn't help us very much."
5110,2020-04-05,"This data is vitally necessary so that we can ensure ventilators are getting to the right place at the right time. FEMA, HHS, DOD are developing resources within the next 24 hours. They will have a whole different set of criteria. Every day, it's different criteria. Every day, this horrible, invisible enemy changes a course. It changes course."
5111,2020-04-05,"If you were fighting the normal fight, you'd know what's happening. Here is: They hit one, they hit another, they hit another state. They hit areas that you didn't expect. But we're watching it and we're capturing it."
5112,2020-04-05,"Our goal is to stay several days ahead of the needs in each state, but we can only do that if the cities and states utilize real-time local knowledge to provide timely and precise data about actual usage. So we have to be able to do that. And if a state has ventilators, as an example, that they know they're not going to need, they should give them over and we should move them with the other ones. We have now 10,000 in our pipeline, and stockpiled 10,000 — close."
5113,2020-04-05,"And we're moving some into New York, so we're going to need some additional. We're moving some into New York City and state, separately. And we're bringing them to the point where they'll need them."
5114,2020-04-05,"I can also report that, at my direction, 1,000 military personnel are deploying to New York City to assist where they're needed the most. That's the hottest of all the hotspots. New Jersey is right there. It's right next to it. And I don't know if that's overflow, but New Jersey is — it's a great state and it's a very — it's a crowded state also, where you have people on top of people. It's always tough. But we're bringing some of the ventilators. We got some for New Jersey just yesterday, and we're going to bring them some more, including doctors."
5115,2020-04-05,"We're getting doctors, nurses, respiratory specialists, and other support workers. These are from the military. We're taking people now out of our military. We've been doing it, but now we're doing it on a larger basis. And I want to thank Secretary of Defense Esper, who will detail some of what we're doing, tomorrow and Monday."
5116,2020-04-05,"As the situation in Washington State continues to stabilize, we're returning a 300-bed federal medical station to a different location — so where we need it. And we appreciate that. They won't be needing it, and we appreciate them letting us know. We're going to move it to a different location. It was already built."
5117,2020-04-05,"Many governors initially made large requests for federal support for their states in anticipation of a greater number of cases, but the residents of Washington State have done a really good job of following the federal distancing guidelines. They really have."
5118,2020-04-05,"I'm also pleased to report that Oregon will be spending and sending — they're spending a lot of money because they really did stockpile well, and they're also sending 140 ventilators directly to New York, which we appreciate."
5119,2020-04-05,"And I want to thank the Vice President for the great work he's doing every day, dealing with our nation's governors. Mike Pence has been working day and night on this, and we want to get it over. He's got to get a little more sleep than he's getting. He hasn't been getting very much, I will tell you that."
5120,2020-04-05,"And we're all in this together, and it's a beautiful thing to see how people are joining forces to help one another. They really are."
5121,2020-04-05,"In addition to our courageous doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, I also want to thank the incredible food supply workers who are feeding our nation. I spoke just a little while ago to Senator Boozman. You know Senator Boozman; we all do. He's a great senator. He's a great person. We spoke just this morning, and we discussed how important it is to keep our farmers and ranchers, processors, and distributors in our nation's prayers. And I want to thank the senator for the incredible job he's been doing. And a lot of the senators and congressmen and everyone — everybody is working very hard."
5122,2020-04-05,"My administration is working very aggressively to pioneer new medical countermeasures to treat and prevent infection. Working on a lot of things. We must utilize our nation's scientific brilliance to vanquish the virus. We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can, because we have a lot of things happening in this country, and we have a great future, but we have to get back to work."
5123,2020-04-05,"This week, the FDA established the Coronavirus Treatment Accelerator Program, which is expediting the development of new anti- — antiviral and other therapies, and they're doing it on a very rapid basis. And I think we're having some very good results. We'll tell you about that."
5124,2020-04-05,"HHS continues to speed the development of therapies derived from human blood that have the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness. And as you know, last Saturday, the FDA also gave emergency authorization for hydroxychloroquine. And the hydroxychloroquine is a — I hope it's going to be a very important answer. We're having some very good things happening with it, and we're going to be distributing it through the Strategic National Stockpile. It's going into the Strategic National Stockpile to treat certain patients. And we have millions and millions of doses of it; 29 million to be exact."
5125,2020-04-05,"In addition to that, we're making it and we're also getting it from various other locations and countries. In one case, I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning. They make large amounts of hydroxychloroquine — very large amounts, frankly. And I said — they had a hold, because, you know, they have 1.5. billion people, and they think a lot of it. And I said I'd appreciate it if they would release the amounts that we ordered. And they are giving it serious consideration. But they do make — India makes a lot of it."
5126,2020-04-05,"But we have already 29 million. If you look — I mean, that's a big number. Twenty-nine million doses. And we've got millions of doses that are being made here and many millions of doses that are made elsewhere that are being shipped here, and it will be arriving."
5127,2020-04-05,"We're just hearing really positive stories, and we're continuing to collect the data. But I'll just speak for myself: It's been out for a long time. It's a malaria drug. It's also a drug for lupus. And there's a — there's a study out that people with lupus aren't catching this horrible virus. They're not — they're not affected so much by it. Now, maybe that's correct; maybe it's false. You're going to have to check it out."
5128,2020-04-05,"But there's a lot of very positive things happening with that. That's a game changer if that's the case. Obviously, we continue to work on the vaccines, but the vaccines have to be down the road by probably 14, 15, 16 months. We're doing great on the vaccines. I think Johnson &amp; Johnson is leading — seems to be leading in terms of the studies, but we'll see what happens. But I feel good about that, but that's down the road."
5129,2020-04-05,"But tremendous promise with — with what's just been mentioned. In addition to that, Gilead Sciences has initiated a phase three that's down the line, meaning clinical studies of the drug remdesivir. Now, it's approximately 1,000 patients, which is a pretty — pretty good study. Other drugs are also being studied in patients."
5130,2020-04-05,"And this week, Oracle, a great company, donated a new web portal — Larry Ellison, amazing guy — and platform to the government to gather real-time data on how patients are responding to the various new treatments. And they have a very sophisticated site, we'll be learning a lot from Oracle. And thank you to them."
5131,2020-04-05,"We're also spending economic dollars like you wouldn't believe, and speeding economic relief to American workers, families, and businesses. Yesterday, the Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program to help employees keep paying their workers. In 24 hours, the Small Business Administration, and over 1,200 lending partners, processed over 28,000 loans — it's, so far, ahead of schedule — and billions and billions of dollars."
5132,2020-04-05,"It's worked out incredibly well, and I want to thank Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and a lot of the big banks that have been involved, and a lot of the community banks. Community banks have really jumped on it. And it's, so far, going way ahead of schedule."
5133,2020-04-05,"The SBA also clarified that faith-based organizations, including houses of worship, are eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program — that's great — as well as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program that you're familiar with, on the same terms as every other applicant."
5134,2020-04-05,"If we run out of funding for the employee retention program, I will immediately ask Congress for more money. This is money that's really going directly to the people that need it — the small businesses that need it and the workers that need it."
5135,2020-04-05,"Finally, I can — because when we open, we want to open strong, with businesses that are going. Remember, we had the greatest economy in the world, and then one day, we were told we got to shut it down, stop it, tell everyone to stay home, because of this horrible virus. And we did that, and we did the right thing. But now we have to open. We have to open our country."
5136,2020-04-05,"Finally, I can report that as of today, the State Department has successfully coordinated the safe return of more than 40,000 Americans stuck abroad on over 400 flights from 75 countries. Many of those countries were terrific in helping us, and I appreciate that very much."
5137,2020-04-05,"Some of them, I had to call the leaders of the country, most of whom I know. And once I did, they snapped, like you wouldn't believe. They really helped us great. So I appreciate that. So we brought back 40,000 Americans who were literally stuck in some countries, with no chance of getting out, and we got them back. Four hundred flights, seventy-five countries. Think of that. And those countries, in almost every instance, had a big problem with the virus."
5138,2020-04-05,"I want to thank the American people, most of all, for the selfless sacrifices that they're making for our nation. I know it's not pleasant, although some people have said they've gotten to know their family better, and they love their family more than ever, and that's a beautiful thing. They've actually gotten to know them. They're in the same house with their family for a long time. I guess it can also work the other way, perhaps, but we don't want to talk about that."
5139,2020-04-05,"And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on slowing the spread. Sustaining this war effort is — and that's what it is; this is a war effort — is the patriotic duty of every citizen. While we may be more physically distant for a time, we're closer together in the heart and in the spirit."
5140,2020-04-05,"And through this, great national unity is happening. We're having a great unity developing that a lot of people didn't think would be possible to develop like this."
5141,2020-04-05,"And we will conquer the disease and restore our nation to its full and glorious might. We're doing really well, and I'm very proud of everybody out there. We're very proud of you. It's something that nobody could have ever projected. It's been over 100 years that a thing like this has happened."
5142,2020-04-05,"And the problem with this one is the contagion. It's so contagious. Nobody has ever seen anything like that where it's so contagious. You can be feet away and just talking to somebody and catch it. You can catch it. You know how long it can live on surfaces. So things that nobody even thought of, the level of contagion."
5143,2020-04-05,"So, we're getting there. We're going to make sure that it's over soon. And just keep going. It's not going to be long."
5144,2020-04-05,"And thank you very much. And with that, I'd like to ask Dr. Hahn to speak. And he's been doing yeoman's work at the FDA."
5145,2020-04-05,"Thank you very much. Doctor, thank you."
5146,2020-04-05,"Tony, please."
5147,2020-04-05,"Thank you. Okay, please."
5148,2020-04-05,I don't think so.
5149,2020-04-05,"Look, there are some states that are — you have great distance, natural distance. Big land, few people. And they're in very good shape. And if there is a case, they can quarantine that person, or that person will be separated, will be brought to a hospital, a secure area."
5150,2020-04-05,"So you do have different cases as opposed to a New York or Los Angeles. Los Angeles is doing incredibly well, by the way. But areas we have lots of people tight together. It's a big difference."
5151,2020-04-05,"So, no, it's — they're different — there are many different cases."
5152,2020-04-05,Please.
5153,2020-04-05,"No, not mass. Many of the places are really in great shape. They really have done a fantastic job. And we may add to the thousand. But New York will be getting about 1,000 military people — nurses, doctors, lots of other people — because that's what they need."
5154,2020-04-05,Yeah.
5155,2020-04-05,"And that's — medical. No, no, medical military. Medical military."
5156,2020-04-05,Please.
5157,2020-04-05,Thinking about it.
5158,2020-04-05,"Thinking about it. Getting a group of people. And we have to open our country. You know, I had an expression: “The cure can't be worse than the problem itself.” Right? I started by saying that and I continue to say it: The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. We've got to get our country open."
5159,2020-04-05,"Absolutely, I want — I want fans back in the arenas."
5160,2020-04-05,I think it's — I think it's — no.
5161,2020-04-05,"Whenever we're ready. I mean, as soon as we can, obviously. And the fans want to be back too. You know, they want to see basketball and baseball and football and hockey. They want to see their sports. They want to go out onto the golf courses and breathe nice, clean, beautiful fresh air. No, the —"
5162,2020-04-05,"I can't tell you — I can't tell you a date, but I think it's going to be sooner rather than later."
5163,2020-04-05,"But — and, you know, we're not going to have to have separation for the rest of our times on the planet. We need it for this period of time. But eventually people are going to be able to occupy those seats and arenas, next to each other, like we have for all of my life and all of your life. They want to sit next to each other at restaurants. They don't want to be, you know, six feet away."
5164,2020-04-05,"And some restaurant man called up, and he said, “You know, I'm worried because I have a small restaurant with not too many seats.” I think he said 120. And he said, “If I practice what this is, I'm down to 30 seats. I can't make it.” I said, “Don't worry about it. That's for a short period of time. You'll be back to your number of seats.” We can't do that. Otherwise, you're making everything — that means your stadium is half the size of what it was a month ago."
5165,2020-04-05,"No, no, they're going to be close together, but they're going to be breathing air that's not infected, that's not going to kill people."
5166,2020-04-05,Please.
5167,2020-04-05,"Well, I'm not committing to it. I'm not committing to it. We're going to see where we are. That'd be great if we could. But we're going to be back to good health soon, in my opinion. We're making a lot of progress, and we're making progress because, as Tony told the story about the restaurant and about how they were separated sort of automatically, people are doing that. People are doing that. They're staying in their homes. They don't want to go out. They're doing what they know is the right thing to do. It's — it's not very complicated. It's — in many ways, it's a very beautiful thing to see."
5168,2020-04-05,Yeah.
5169,2020-04-05,"We have no contingency plan. We're having the convention at the end of August, and we think by the end of August, we'll be in good shape. We have no contingen- — you know, it's going to be in North Carolina, as you know, in Charlotte. And I think we're going to have a great convention."
5170,2020-04-05,"I notice — I think we had an opponent, but I — I almost didn't know who it was. He got .00001 percent of the vote. But I heard he dropped out three or four weeks ago. I'm not sure. Maybe you could tell me. That's the kind of opponent I had. And hopefully we have another one just like that in Joe."
5171,2020-04-05,"Well, I think we're going to need more money for the small businesses. It's been working out so well. It's been so efficient. The banks have been doing an incredible job. I think we're going to need more money there, I think. You know, we'll see. But based on the first — the first couple of days, it's been incredible."
5172,2020-04-05,"I think that restaurants and entertainment — and that would be — include sports leagues, all forms of entertainment — go back to the original, where they get tax deductibility for what they're doing and for people who come in and buy tickets or go out for meals. And corporations can then send people into these restaurants who are going to have a hard time, otherwise, opening, in my opinion. And that could be the same for the sports leagues."
5173,2020-04-05,"So we want to see, for entertainment and for restaurants, deductibility so that corporations can take a deduction. They'll send their executives, they'll send people there, and they get a deduction. That is something that will really bring life back to the restaurants; I think make them hotter than before."
5174,2020-04-05,"You know, they used to have it. And when they ended it, it was really never the same. It was never the same."
5175,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please."
5176,2020-04-05,That's right. That's right.
5177,2020-04-05,"Well, Tennessee just did it."
5178,2020-04-05,Yeah. Yeah.
5179,2020-04-05,"We have a thing called the Constitution, which I cherish, number one. Number two, those governors — I know every one of them — they're doing a great job. They're being very, very successful in what they're doing. And as you know, I want the governors to be running things."
5180,2020-04-05,"Now, in some cases, we'll supersede, but in this case it's not —"
5181,2020-04-05,"I think it depends — it depends on the individual state that you're talking about. But they're doing very well, and they're doing a magnificent job in running their states."
5182,2020-04-05,"No, I think they're doing a great job."
5183,2020-04-05,"Well, that's a very small number relative to population."
5184,2020-04-05,"That's okay. It's up to the — if I saw something wrong, I saw a massive breakout — of which that's not — I would come down very hard. But —"
5185,2020-04-05,"No, not in that case. But in the case — I know the states you're talking about. By the way, I think you're up to 92 percent is covered. Ninety-two percent of the country is covered. And from a constitutional standpoint, they made the difference. They called the shots."
5186,2020-04-05,"Yes, Jeff. Go ahead."
5187,2020-04-05,"No, I'm just saying we have to get this country open, Jeff. It has to get open. This country was not designed to be closed. So we have the greatest we've ever had, and then we're paying people to stay home."
5188,2020-04-05,Think of it: We're paying people not to go to work. How about that? How does that play?
5189,2020-04-05,"And they want to go to work, by the way. They don't even want — they don't want money. This country is great. But we're paying people. We have to get back to work. That's what I'm saying."
5190,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
5191,2020-04-05,"I thought he did a terrible job. Absolutely terrible. He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report — it was fake. It was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the President of Ukraine. He took a fake report and he brought it to Congress, with an emergency. Okay? Not a big Trump fan — that, I can tell you."
5192,2020-04-05,"Instead of saying — and we offered this to him: “No, no, we will take the conversation” — where, fortunately, we had that transcript. If we didn't have a transcript with the kind of deception and dishonesty that were practiced by the Democrats, I might not be standing here right now. Okay? Fortunately, we had a transcript and it was a perfect transcript, because even the lieutenant colonel admitted it was correct. Okay?"
5193,2020-04-05,Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You asked a question.
5194,2020-04-05,"So he took this whistleblower — and I keep saying, “Where's the whistleblower?” Right? “And why was the whistleblower allowed to do this?” Why was he allowed to be — you call it fraudulent or incorrect transcript."
5195,2020-04-05,"So we offered this IG — I don't know him; I don't think I ever met him. I don't think I — he never even came in to see me. How can you do that without seeing the person? Never came in to see me. Never requested to see me. He took this terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report — right? — and he brought it to Congress."
5196,2020-04-05,"We offered to have him see my exact conversation. It was all about the conversation, by the way. That was the whole thing, was about the conversation. Right? And then after he saw it, he must've said, “Wow,” because as I've said it many times and it drives you people crazy, it was a perfect conversation."
5197,2020-04-05,"So instead of going and saying, “Gee, this is a terrible thing he said about the President's conversation” — well, it was a fraud. I didn't say that. And, by the way, you have the whistleblower. Where's the informer? Right?"
5198,2020-04-05,"And here's another question: Remember before I did the — before I gave the transcript — in other words, before I revealed the real conversation — where's the second whistleblower? Remember the second whistle —"
5199,2020-04-05,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. There was going to be a second whistleblower. But after I gave the conversation, he just went away. He miraculously went away."
5200,2020-04-05,Where's the informer? Because there was going to be this informer. Maybe Schiff was the informer. You ever think of that? He's a corrupt guy. He's a corrupt politician.
5201,2020-04-05,"So, listen, I say this: Where's the informer? Remember, the informer was coming forward. But I gave — because, see, I did one thing that surprised everybody. This gentleman right here said, “Boy, that was a shocker.” I revealed the conversation. I got approval from Ukraine because I didn't want to do it without their approval. And they said, “Absolutely. You did nothing wrong.”"
5202,2020-04-05,"By the way, President of Ukraine, Foreign Minister said, “He did nothing wrong.” And over that, with 196 to nothing vote by the Republicans — not one dissenting Republican vote — dishonest Democrats impeached a President of the United States. That man is a disgrace to IGs."
5203,2020-04-05,"All right, let's go. Next. Please. He's a total disgrace."
5204,2020-04-05,"Okay, we'll get off this because people want to talk about what we're talking about. But let me just tell you something: That's my decision. I have the absolute right. Even the fake news last night said, “He has the absolute right to do it.”"
5205,2020-04-05,"But ask him, “Why didn't you go and see the actual conversation?” There was no rush. He said, “Oh we'd have to rush it.” He even said it was politically biased. He actually said that. The report could have been — you know who the whistleblower is, and so do you and so does everybody in this room, and so do I. Everybody knows. But they give this whistleblower a status that he doesn't deserve. He's a fake whistleblower. And, frankly, somebody ought to sue his ass off."
5206,2020-04-05,"All right, it's enough with the whistleblower."
5207,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
5208,2020-04-05,"Well, what he didn't say is — okay, let me tell you what he didn't say."
5209,2020-04-05,"Two very good friends of mine brought him those whistleblower — brought him those ventilators, right? Two very good friends of mine — they brought them. If you'd like their name, I'll give you their name."
5210,2020-04-05,"No, but he — the governor didn't —"
5211,2020-04-05,"— mention that. It came through the Chinese — the country of China. But they were given by two friends of mine, but he didn't tell you that."
5212,2020-04-05,"Now, the governor also —"
5213,2020-04-05,You'll see when you read the letter.
5214,2020-04-05,"The governor also asked for 40,000 — 40,000. He wanted 40,000 ventilators."
5215,2020-04-05,"Now, the governor, as you know, had a chance to get 16,000 a few years ago. He decided not to get that. The State of New York has asked for help. I've given him four hospitals, four medical centers. Then I gave him an additional hospital. Then I gave him military people to operate the hospital. They were not supposed to be COVID hospitals. The boat — the ship is not — an interesting thing happened with the ship. People aren't in accidents because there's nobody driving. There's nobody taking motorcycle rides down the West Side Highway at 100 miles an hour. People are away. So people aren't being injured."
5216,2020-04-05,"Now they're asking whether or not we could open up the ship for COVID. We have given the governor of New York more than anybody has ever been given in a long time. I'll just say — I was going to say “in history,” but in a long time. And I think he's happy."
5217,2020-04-05,"But I think that — because I watched what he said today, and it was fine. I wouldn't say gracious. It wasn't gracious. It was okay. I must tell you, Gavin Newsom has been gracious –Los Angeles, California, the job we've done, and all of California."
5218,2020-04-05,"It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. But I think when we've given as much as we've given to New York, somebody should say —"
5219,2020-04-05,"Nice — I'll tell you who's been very nice: Mayor de Blasio has been very nice. He understands what we've given him. We brought him some more ventilators, too, yesterday."
5220,2020-04-05,"But nobody has been given like New York. And I think — I know he appreciates it. He just can't quite get the words out, but that's okay."
5221,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
5222,2020-04-05,To which one?
5223,2020-04-05,Yeah.
5224,2020-04-05,"Well, Deb, I think maybe you should answer that, right? Dr. Birx, please?"
5225,2020-04-05,"Yeah, sure — go ahead."
5226,2020-04-05,"Before I do that, you had breaking news last night — you know that; you saw that — where I think the probable presidential candidate for the Democrats will be Joe Biden, and he agreed that he was correct when I stopped people from China very early — very, very early — from coming into our country. And Dr. Fauci said that was a very big moment because it would be a much different picture we have right now had we allowed thousands and thousands of people from a specific area — I don't have to go into it — from China, to come in highly infected. It would have been a very different thing."
5227,2020-04-05,"The other thing — so I appreciate the fact that he did, because I was called “xenophobic,” “racist.” I was called many things when I did that very early. And I got a lot of credit for it in the Federalist. Because the Federalist covered the whole journey. And they said Trump was — I didn't speak to the author — respected author. They said, “Trump was right at every single move. And on top of that, he was going through a fake impeachment,” a hoax. I was going through a hoax, when I made the decision. And that does take a little time and certainly a little thinking time."
5228,2020-04-05,But I appreciated the fact that Joe Biden announced last night that he now agrees that I was correct. You saw the report come out — that I was correct when I stopped people from China coming at a very early date.
5229,2020-04-05,Which one? What?
5230,2020-04-05,Yeah.
5231,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know much about it."
5232,2020-04-05,I can only tell you this —
5233,2020-04-05,Here we have one of the greatest — here we have one of the greatest ships in the world. Nuclear aircraft carrier. Incredible ship with thousands and thousands of people. And you had about 120 that were infected.
5234,2020-04-05,"Now, I guess the captain stopped in Vietnam and people got off in Vietnam. Perhaps you don't do that in the middle of a pandemic or — or something that looked like it was going to be — you know, history would say you don't necessarily stop and let your sailors gets off, number one."
5235,2020-04-05,"But more importantly, he wrote a letter. The letter was a five-page letter from a captain, and the letter was all over the place. That's not appropriate. I don't think that's appropriate. And these are tough people. These are tough, strong people."
5236,2020-04-05,"I thought it looked terrible, to be honest with you. Now, they made their decision. I didn't make the decision. Secretary of Defense was involved and a lot of people were involved. I thought it was terrible what he did to write a letter. I mean, this isn't a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that's nuclear powered. And he shouldn't be talking that way in a letter. He could call and ask and suggest."
5237,2020-04-05,But he stopped in Vietnam. A lot of people got off the boat. They came back and they had infection. And I thought it was inappropriate for the captain of a ship to do —
5238,2020-04-05,I don't want to — I don't want to comment as to whether or not. But I agree with their decision 100 percent.
5239,2020-04-05,"In the back, please."
5240,2020-04-05,He just what?
5241,2020-04-05,"Well, he didn't write anything. Look, he has people — he has professionals from the Democrats writing."
5242,2020-04-05,"Okay, he didn't write that. That was done by a Democrat operative. He doesn't write. He doesn't — he's probably not even watching right now. And if he is, he doesn't understand what he's watching."
5243,2020-04-05,"But just so you understand, it was very nice what they wrote. And, I don't know — you know, they released it at a strange time. You know, sort of a strange time to release something like that. But he admitted I was right."
5244,2020-04-05,"And if you read the Federalist story, which most of you won't because you don't want to, but you'd learn something, because if you go — it goes to a chart, times."
5245,2020-04-05,"I was early. Dr. Fauci, I think — I don't think he's changed his mind, but he said it was a very important step when we stopped China from coming in from the specific area that was heavily infected. We'd have a whole different thing right now."
5246,2020-04-05,"So I don't really know what Joe Biden said. I don't really care. And again, I see — every once in a while I'll say something, I'll make a speech, and then it'll be critiqued and I'll get this beautiful, brilliant critique. Joe Biden didn't write that. Joe Biden didn't write that. He wished he did, but he didn't."
5247,2020-04-05,Go ahead. Please. Back.
5248,2020-04-05,"All right, Jeff, go ahead."
5249,2020-04-05,"We're very disappointed in 3M. They should be taking care of our country. And they can sell to others, but they should be taking care of our country."
5250,2020-04-05,"The people that have dealt with them have dealt successfully with many companies over the last month. They don't like the way 3M has treated our country. They don't, frankly, like the representatives of 3M. And no act of pir- — you said piracy, right? Piracy?"
5251,2020-04-05,"There's been no act of piracy. No, there's been no act of piracy. It's the opposite. 3M has not treated our country well. And if they do, great. And if they don't, they're going to have a hell of a price to pay. Okay?"
5252,2020-04-05,"I say it that way. And I watched him on television, on something, talking about how “this is so hard to believe, so hard to fathom.” They ought to get their act together. Because I got involved and I looked at what happened, and they have not — 3M has not treated our country well."
5253,2020-04-05,"Go ahead, please."
5254,2020-04-05,We'll get you the information.
5255,2020-04-05,"And I hope they use the hydroxychloroquine, and they can also do it with Z-Pak, subject to your doctor's approval, and all of that. But I hope they use it because I'll tell you what: What do you have to lose? In some cases, they're in bad shape. What do you have to lose? It's been out there for a long time, and I hope they use it. And they're going to look at the — with doctors. Work with doctors. Get what you have to get. But we have it stockpiled, and it's — we have a lot of it, and we're getting more of it."
5256,2020-04-05,"And as I told you, I spoke to Prime Minister Modi. We're getting more of it, but we have a lot of it. And I hope they use it, because it's been used for a long time and therefore it's passed the safety test. FDA has been terrific. Dr. Hahn, I appreciate it very much, too. But I've seen some results."
5257,2020-04-05,"Now, it's early, I guess. It's early. But — and you should — they should look at the lupus thing. I don't know what it says, but there's a rumor out there that — because it takes care of lupus very effectively, as I understand it. It's a, you know, a drug that's used for lupus."
5258,2020-04-05,"So there's a study out there that says people that have lupus haven't been catching this virus. You know, maybe it's true, maybe it's not. Why don't you investigate that?"
5259,2020-04-05,"And there's also other studies, you know, with the malaria, that the malaria countries have very little — people that take this drug for malaria, which is very effective for malaria — that those countries have very little of this virus. I don't know. You're going to check it out."
5260,2020-04-05,"But I think people should — if it were me — in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it. Okay? I may take it. And I'll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it."
5261,2020-04-05,"Yeah, please go ahead."
5262,2020-04-05,"Well, OPEC can do whatever — look, I've been against OPEC all my life, because what is it? It's an illegal — you could call it a cartel, you could call it a monopoly. You have a lot of different names for it. But it broke down very violently. Very violently."
5263,2020-04-05,So I don't care about OPEC. I really don't.
5264,2020-04-05,I couldn't care less about OPEC.
5265,2020-04-05,"Let me just say — no, no. I think they're going to settle it. You know why? Because they're going to be destroyed. They're destroying themselves if they don't."
5266,2020-04-05,"Russia — it's a very important — and we had a very good conversation, President Putin and myself. Very good. But Russia — a big part of their economic wellbeing is from oil. Well, oil is at a record low. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. It's actually lower than you even think. And it's to their advantage. Obviously, it's to Saudi Arabia's advantage."
5267,2020-04-05,"They told me they're discussing. Saudi Arabia went much further than that. He thinks that a deal is going to be made at 10 million barrels reduction, and maybe more than that. He actually indicated it would most likely be much more than that. So we'll see what happens. I mean, we're going to see what happens."
5268,2020-04-05,"But as far as OPEC is concerned, I mean, I was against OPEC for years and years because I thought it was very unfair to our country. The beautiful thing is we have built one of the great — you know, one of the things we've done is created so much. We — we produce. We're the number one producer in the world right now. I don't like it for a different reason: because it's going to hurt a lot of jobs in our country, this price. It's going to hurt a lot of jobs."
5269,2020-04-05,"Now, with all of that being said, people are going to be driving, paying 90 cents a gallon. Did you ever hear of that? What's that, 1952 or something? All right?"
5270,2020-04-05,"So from that standpoint — but you know what? I am a big believer in our great energy business, and we're going to take care of our energy business. And if I have to do tariffs on oil coming from outside, or if I have to do something to protect — or thousands and tens of thousands of energy workers, and our great companies that produce all these jobs — I'll do whatever I have to do."
5271,2020-04-05,"Okay, yeah, ma'am. Go ahead."
5272,2020-04-05,"Well, he's a good athlete, and he loves soccer. And he — he's like everyone else. I mean, everything shut down. He's in his room. He's happy, but he's not as happy as you could be. He'd like to be playing sports. Barron."
5273,2020-04-05,"And let's see what happens. But we have to get back. We have to get back. Remember that. We have to get back, and we have to get back soon. Okay?"
5274,2020-04-05,"Do you guys ever stop? Do you want to keep going for a little while? Huh? I mean, do you ever stop? How many times do you ask — and in many cases, it's the same — actually, a lot of good questions."
5275,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
5276,2020-04-05,But keep going? Yes?
5277,2020-04-05,"So you're not going to blame me that I kept it going too long? People said, “Oh, he kept...”"
5278,2020-04-05,"No. I mean, no, it's amazing. I'm telling you, every hand went up. I thought we've gone through — and they're all — every —"
5279,2020-04-05,I think every single hand went up the last time.
5280,2020-04-05,You know what it shows you? It shows you that you love what you do.
5281,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
5282,2020-04-05,"You do. No, you do. And some of you do it well. Not all of you."
5283,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
5284,2020-04-05,"I'm not looking at you, by the way."
5285,2020-04-05,"Look, the job numbers are what they are. We asked everybody to go home, don't work. So the numbers are going to be, you know, astronomical. We understand that. I understood that."
5286,2020-04-05,"I know somebody said that the numbers are meaningless, and then they took that to mean, “Oh, jobs don't mean anything.” And, you know, it was just another fake news story. It wasn't me that said it, by the way. It was a very smart person. But they meant it by saying it really is what — that's why I answer your question very carefully. The numbers are what they are. We know the numbers were going to be massive, because we told everybody to go home and lock your door, essentially. Right? “Don't come to work. You can't come to work. Don't go outside. Don't breathe. Don't do anything.”"
5287,2020-04-05,"We got to open up our country. But I know — I know that it's coming back. And in my opinion, it will come back very strong. There's a tremendous energy. There's a tremendous demand. And some good things have happened."
5288,2020-04-05,"I mean — I don't know. You know, there's one habit that, as you know, most of you — and a lot of you have covered me a long time before I did this — I was never a big believer in shaking hands. But I decided, if you don't shake hands, you're not going to be winning a lot of contests. Right now, I'm not sure you have to shake hands anymore."
5289,2020-04-05,"A couple of people have told me — Deborah, you told me that if we didn't shake hands, the incidence of flu — flu is a big deal also — and that flu might be cut down in half. Who knew that shaking hands was such a bad thing? I felt it. I mean, I always felt it. And, you know, I was never to a point where I can't shake somebody's hand. I knew people like that too. But there aren't too many of them."
5290,2020-04-05,"But when I ran for office, all of a sudden, I'm shaking hundreds of hands. And if I don't, I wouldn't even be standing here. But I think that's a custom that maybe people don't have to. We have to get close together, we have to sit together at the stadiums, we have to sit next to each other in restaurants. All that stuff is going to happen, but I think the concept of shaking hands maybe is something that's going to be a little bit from the past. Let's see what happens. Maybe they'll go right back to shaking hands."
5291,2020-04-05,Good.
5292,2020-04-05,"Well, we've seen a lot of that. You might say something there. I have seen such support. I saw this morning where everyone — they're clapping for fire department, they're clapping for police. But they are really going — these people are —"
5293,2020-04-05,"You know what they're like? They're like — Tony, they're like warriors. Mike, they're like warriors. They were going into Elmhurst Hospital, which has been tragic — right near where I grew up, in Queens — going in. And the people in buildings — there's — going. I mean, they're the rockstars. They're warriors. Nurses, doctors, first responders, what they're — what they're going through."
5294,2020-04-05,"And they don't even know what's going to happen. I mean, they go in. And, by the way, even if they have great equipment they're catching it. You know, great equipment. They have good equipment, they catch it. They catch it with good, with bad. It is evil."
5295,2020-04-05,"But, Tony, you might say something. And, Mike, you may say something about that."
5296,2020-04-05,Pretty much what's happening.
5297,2020-04-05,"Mike, please."
5298,2020-04-05,"And think also about the Army Corps of Engineers. Now, it's a little different, depending on where they are and where they're working. But the Army Corps of Eng- — throwing up a hospital in New York City: 2,500 beds in three days? I mean, think of that. And FEMA, what they're doing. And the National Guard is now delivering for the state because the state were unable to get — we'd drop it at a big warehouse where we're told to drop it, and the states were unable — some of the states were unable to bring it from the warehouse to the site."
5299,2020-04-05,"So we got the National Guard to become a delivery service, if you can believe it, and they would bring it. And some of those sites were dangerous sites. They were very dangerous sites. Think of that. It's been amazing. It's been amazing."
5300,2020-04-05,"I just think — I've never seen anything like it. I'm so proud of this country. And, really, it's a world problem and some countries in the world are just handling it so well."
5301,2020-04-05,"You know, again, I keep saying it: It's 151. That was as of two, three days ago. It's probably more. Some people said they didn't know there were that many countries. That's how big this is."
5302,2020-04-05,"And Mike said something also. You have Palm Sunday tomorrow. Think of it. We're not going to churches on Palm Sunday. But think of next Sunday: Easter. And I brought it up before: I said, maybe we could allow special for churches. Maybe we could talk about it. Maybe we could allow them, with great separation, outside on Easter Sunday. I don't know, it's something we should talk about."
5303,2020-04-05,"But somebody did say that, well, then you're sort of opening it up to that little — you know, do we want to take a chance on doing that when we've been doing so well."
5304,2020-04-05,"But Easter Sunday, Palm Sunday. I'm going to be watching tomorrow live from Riverside, California — a great church. But I'm going to be watching on a computer. Right? On a laptop. I think, on Easter, maybe I'll be watching from a laptop as opposed —"
5305,2020-04-05,"So how sad is it that we have Easter Palm and Easter Sunday, and people are watching on laptops and computers? It's sad."
5306,2020-04-05,"But — but the job that this whole country has done is amazing. But I'll say this: Our medical professionals, what they've done, because they are — they walk into those hospitals; you see them putting on their gear and they're putting it on as they're walking through the front doors. And some of those people are going to die. They're going to die. You know, it's, like, incredible."
5307,2020-04-05,"And we can say what we want, Tony and Deb, about young and medium-aged. There are plenty of those people dying too. You know, it's — it generally hits the older people where they have problems. It hits young people too, and it hits middle-aged people too."
5308,2020-04-05,"But these people are walking into hospitals, and they watch — I can't — I think it's — it's incredible. And they're putting their outfit, they're getting it ready. And they're going in. They're going — it's like — it's like a — it's like a war."
5309,2020-04-05,"Again, there's never been anything so contagious as this. In 1917, it was vicious if you got it, but it wasn't contagious like this."
5310,2020-04-05,"Now, in 1917, had they had the Internet and all the means of communication, they could have practiced distancing. You know, by the time, people started thinking in terms — in those terms, they lost, I guess, 75 to 100 million people. So that's modern — you know, that's a modern day, great thing that happened."
5311,2020-04-05,Please.
5312,2020-04-05,"Well, I don't know. I'd rather leave that to the doctor. Doctor, do you have an answer to that?"
5313,2020-04-05,"And mitigation does work. But again, we're not going to destroy our country. We have to get back. Because, you know, at a certain point, you'll lose more people this way — through all of the problems caused — than you will with what we're doing right now. What we're doing right now, I think it's going to be very successful. But you know what?"
5314,2020-04-05,I don't know. We're going to — we have a big decision to make at a certain point. Okay? We have a big decision to make. We went this extra period of time.
5315,2020-04-05,"But I've said it from the beginning: The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. And we cannot let that happen. We have an incredible country. We were having the greatest period in our country's history, from an economic standpoint and many other ways. We cannot let this continue."
5316,2020-04-05,"So at a certain point, some hard decisions are going to have to be made."
5317,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
5318,2020-04-05,That's true.
5319,2020-04-05,"Could be. I mean, it could be you have shortages, and it could also be that you have some that have way overestimated the number of ventilators they need."
5320,2020-04-05,"We think that — you know, we have a good — a good amount ready to move. I mean, literally, like an army, they're ready to move to any hotspot. But some of the ones that you're talking about — always a nasty question from CNN — but some of the ones."
5321,2020-04-05,"Because I think that, frankly, you know —"
5322,2020-04-05,Because you know what? You've asked that question about 10 times over the course of about a month.
5323,2020-04-05,"Look, we're mobilized and ready to go. We have a lot of ventilators ready to go. And if we had given them all out, we wouldn't, and you would be overstocked in many areas."
5324,2020-04-05,"What we're doing is we have a very good plan to take from some areas, even though we have the 10, or almost the 10,000. We're also taking from areas that won't be as badly hit as today we think they will be. There will be some areas hit harder than we think. And there's nothing that Deborah or Tony or any of these professionals can do about it."
5325,2020-04-05,"This thing moves in a lot of ways. But what we're going to do is we are going to have — and if you look at us compared to a lot of other countries, we're in much better shape. But these professionals have done an amazing job."
5326,2020-04-05,"Now, over the next week and two weeks — this is going to be a very, very deadly period, unfortunately — but we're going to make it so that we lose as few lives as possible. And I think we're going to be successful. I think we already are successful in that regard."
5327,2020-04-05,"When you look at that graph and you see all of the — the “bumps,” if you want to call it, at a very low level, and you see a couple at a higher level — they were tough — but you see all of those levels. You know, when you look in — and when you hear about Italy and then you hear about France and then you hear about — you know, what we have is we have many Italys all over. We have — they're like countries. California is a country; New York is a country — if you look at them from the standpoint of what we're talking about."
5328,2020-04-05,"We have many, like, country spots. Some are hotspots and there's nothing we're going to do about it. One of the biggest surprises is Louisiana because it started off so good, and then all of a sudden, it shot up like a rocket. But we are going to try and have ventilators wherever we possibly can."
5329,2020-04-05,"Jeff, go ahead."
5330,2020-04-05,Sure. Sure.
5331,2020-04-05,"Well, New York wanted 40,000 ventilators, okay? Forty thousand. Think of what 40,000 is. It's like cars. It's a big project. It's an expensive product. I mean, some of them are $50,000 apiece. I saw one the other day: 55,000. That was before they start playing the games with supply and demand, okay? Some are very, very — you call them “luxury.” Some are not."
5332,2020-04-05,"But, frankly, these are very expensive products. These are very high-tech projects and products, and they take a period of time. We have thousands of them being built right now. Some will be ready. And we're going to have extra, and we'll keep them at hospitals. But a lot of hospitals, a lot of states had the chance of getting ventilators, and they turned those ventilators down for — so they could spend their money on something else."
5333,2020-04-05,"And in a way, I understand that because who thinks a thing like this — it's not a knock. If I'm told — like, perhaps New York — you can spend a billion dollars on ventilators and get 16,000 or a massive number of ventilators that they've been offered over the years, or you can build a new bridge or road or something. I mean, I understand how that works. I'm not blaming anybody. I'm just saying they — a lot of the states had chances of stockpiling a lot of ventilators. They didn't do it. And I think we're doing a very good job in helping them out."
5334,2020-04-05,"Please, Jeff."
5335,2020-04-05,And it's a very fair question. I understand that question very well.
5336,2020-04-05,Yeah.
5337,2020-04-05,"Sure. I'd like to ask also. Yeah, I'd like to say we know pretty much the line of attack. We know the numbers. The numbers are the numbers. They seem to be checking out, unfortunately. Or in some cases, you know, they're on the low side, which we're very happy. We want to keep them on the very low side, and that's where we're headed. And I think that's maybe where we're headed."
5338,2020-04-05,"But I'd like to ask maybe you and Tony, what are — where is the — where is the week or the number of days of greatest attack? What will be our worst day? If that's possible to determine. I think that's what you're asking, right?"
5339,2020-04-05,And when will that peak be?
5340,2020-04-05,Good. Thanks.
5341,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
5342,2020-04-05,"And one of the reasons that I keep talking about hydroxychloroquine is that the question that nobody ever asks, and the question that I most hate the answer to, is: “What happens if you do have a ventilator? What are your chances?”"
5343,2020-04-05,"And I just hope that hydroxychloroquine wins, coupled with perhaps the Z-Pak, as we call it — dependent totally on your doctors and the doctors there — because you know the answer to that question. If you do have the ventilator, you know the answer to that question. And I hate giving the answer."
5344,2020-04-05,"So I don't want to get them there. I don't want to get them there. There's a possibility — a possibility — and I say it: What do you have to lose? I'll say it again: What do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it. But it's their choice and it's their doctor's choice, or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine — try it, if you'd like."
5345,2020-04-05,"The other thing: If you have a heart condition, I understand. Probably you stay away from the Z-Pak. But that's an antibiotic. It can clean out the lungs. The lungs are a point of attack for this horrible virus."
5346,2020-04-05,"But when you have a ventilator, don't ask the answer because I hate it. If you have it, and it's working beautifully — I don't like the answer, because it's not a very high percentage."
5347,2020-04-05,"So I want to keep them out of ventilators. I want to keep them — if this drug works, it will be not a game changer, because that's not a nice enough term; it will be wonderful. It'll be so beautiful. It'll be a gift from heaven if it works. Because when people go into those ventilators, you know the answers, I know the answers, and I'm glad you don't write about it."
5348,2020-04-05,"Mike, please."
5349,2020-04-05,That's so false. We're way ahead of schedules. The banks have been great.
5350,2020-04-05,"JPMorgan Chase. Bank of America. They're so far ahead. This is typical with you, in particular. “We hear they're behind...” They're not behind. It's been a flawless — it's been flawless, so far. Far beyond our expectations. You should say, “I hear you're doing well, but maybe...”"
5351,2020-04-05,I don't even hear of any glitch. They've done billions of dollars of loans to small business.
5352,2020-04-05,And these are great loans. These are loans that get immediately paid off. These are loans that get businesses back.
5353,2020-04-05,"I wish you could ask a question where something is working so well. Now, maybe things won't work well, and I don't mind that kind. But where something is working so well and you ask a question in such a negative way —"
5354,2020-04-05,"Uh, it's doing great. Yeah, go ahead."
5355,2020-04-05,"It's doing great. Really good. Maybe it won't in two weeks, and I'll respond differently. But it's doing great. You know it and so does everyone else. Everyone is shocked how well it's doing."
5356,2020-04-05,Who did?
5357,2020-04-05,Yes.
5358,2020-04-05,"I don't think it changed much, has it?"
5359,2020-04-05,It's the same pattern. Same answer that we've given you for the last —
5360,2020-04-05,"We can bring an updated graph, but it's very similar."
5361,2020-04-05,Please.
5362,2020-04-05,"We're looking at it very seriously. Right now, we're dealing with governors, we're dealing with airlines, we're dealing with a lot of different factors. It's a very difficult decision. We're also doing testing getting into planes. Very strong testing. States are doing testing of people that leave planes because they don't want to have people coming in who are infected."
5363,2020-04-05,"So understanding that — and the level of testing has been enormous. Okay? And some states are saying you have to go in quarantine for two weeks if you come from certain areas. So, knowing that, we're working with the governors."
5364,2020-04-05,"Both. Both. Some states are doing when they land — they're doing very strong, very powerful testing."
5365,2020-04-05,"Please, go ahead."
5366,2020-04-05,"okay, well, then you'll check them again."
5367,2020-04-05,Governments are doing too — our government.
5368,2020-04-05,Go ahead.
5369,2020-04-05,"Yeah, I would."
5370,2020-04-05,"No, Jack Ma is a friend of mine and he's made it very possible to get about 1,000 from ventilators from China. But that was from him and my other friend. It was really a gift, and we appreciate it very much. It was very nice of them."
5371,2020-04-05,All right. I think we've had enough.
5372,2020-04-05,"We'll be seeing you very soon. And I'm sure that you know that all of us are going to be working very hard. We're working very hard. We are really coming up into a time that's going to be very horrendous, probably a time like we haven't seen in this country. Wouldn't you say? I mean, I don't think we've seen a time like this in the country."
5373,2020-04-05,And we're getting to that — that point where it's going to really be some very bad numbers. And we want to keep those numbers a lot lower than they would have been. And we will do that.
5374,2020-04-05,"We have tremendous talent working. We have tremendous people, and that includes governors; that includes everybody. Everybody is working."
5375,2020-04-05,"But unfortunately, we're getting to that time when the numbers are going to peak, and it's not going to be a good-looking situation. I really believe we probably have never seen anything like these kind of numbers. Maybe during the war, during the — a World War, or a World War One or Two or something. But this is a war all unto itself. And it's — it's a terrible thing."
5376,2020-04-05,"We will be seeing you soon. We'll keep you totally abreast. We're also going to be releasing new ventilator numbers, because we have a lot of them coming and a lot of them going to different locations."
5377,2020-04-05,And we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you.
